Special emphasis is placed on understanding adolescence - its characteristics, problems, and ways to help adolescents.

You have completed Unit II: Attention, Perception and Memory.</p> <p>What you learned:</p> <p>\u2705 Attention (2:01-2:05) - The selective mental process of focusing; types (voluntary/involuntary); 9 characteristics; 8 external and 5 internal determinants; classroom strategies</p> <p>\u2705 Perception (2:06-2:10) - Meaningful interpretation of sensation; Gestalt laws (Pragnanz, Proximity, Similarity, Closure, Continuity); errors (illusion vs hallucination)</p> <p>\u2705 Memory (2:11-2:15) - Three stages (learning, retention, retrieval); STM (7\u00b12 items, 15-30 sec) vs LTM (unlimited, permanent); factors affecting memory; 5 signs of good memory; 12 techniques for better memory</p> <p>Key Takeaways for Teachers: - Use external factors (size, contrast, novelty, movement) to capture attention - Create proper mental set through lesson introduction - Apply Gestalt principles in presenting visual information - Understand STM limitations when presenting new information - Use repetition, organization, and meaningful connections for LTM storage - Apply SQ3R method and proper spacing for effective learning - Arrange subjects to avoid pro-active and retro-active inhibition</p> <p>\ud83d\udcd6 Next Unit: Unit III - Motivation and Learning</p>"}]}
