```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph JUNG["🧠 Jung's Classification"]
        subgraph EXTROVERT["Extrovert"]
            E1[Susceptible to external stimulation]

| **Reaction to Failure** | Less worried about failure | Deeply upset by failure |
| **Self-Criticism** | Lacks self-criticism | Invariably self-centred (excessive self-focus) |

!!! warning "Criticism of Jung's Classification"
    This classification has been criticised on the ground that:
    
    - In general, people have characteristics of **both extroversion and introversion** mixed in them at different levels
    - They exhibit one type in **one situation** and the other in **another situation**
    - **No one is a perfect extrovert or an introvert**

# 5:06:2 Limitations of the Type-Approach

!!! warning "Limitations"

### 1. Physique-Personality Relationship Problem

One serious objection is that **changes of physique** often occur for individuals at **middle age** but this is **not often accompanied by any changes in personality characteristics**.

### 2. Few People Fit Distinct Types

Type approaches have obvious limitations. **Few people fit into such distinct types easily**. Jung himself says that **most persons appear to be atypical or ambiverts**.

### 3. Multiple Aspects of Traits

Even introversion-extroversion now appear to have aspects—one who is **introverted in social activity** may **not be equally so in his thinking**.

### 4. Oversimplification

Human personality is **too rich and often too unusual** to be described in one or two general types.

!!! note "Key Points 📌"
    The type approach tries to describe **practically useful distinctions** among persons, but such distinctions are **only relative**.

!!! tip "Exam Tip 📝"
    **Memory Aid for Theorists:**
    
    - **G**alen = **4** Temperaments (CMPS)
    - **K**retchmer = **3** Body types (APA → Schizo/Cyclo)
    - **S**pranger = **6** Values (TEASPR)
    - **S**heldon = **3** Somatotypes (EME → VSC)
    - **L**ippitt = **3** Leadership (ADL)
    - **J**ung = **2** Types (E-I) - **Most Popular**

---

!!! success "Summary"
    The **Type Approach** attempts to classify people into distinct categories:
    
    - Multiple classification systems exist (Galen, Kretchmer, Spranger, Sheldon, Lippitt, Ogburn, Jung)
    - **Jung's Extrovert-Introvert** is the most popular
    - **Limitations**: People rarely fit neatly into types; distinctions are relative; personality is too complex for simple categorization

---

> **Bridge →** Given the limitations of the Type approach, psychologists developed the Trait approach which describes personality using multiple traits rather than single categories. Let's explore this in Section 5:07.
