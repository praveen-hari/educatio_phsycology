## 📚 Three Major Definitions

### 1. F.S. Freeman's Definition

!!! quote "Definition by F.S. Freeman"
    "An individual's personality is the **resulting individuality** arising out of the **interaction** of a **self-conscious and intelligent person** and the **environment** in which he lives."

| Key Element | Explanation |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Resulting Individuality** | Personality is an outcome, not inborn |
| **Self-conscious** | Aware of oneself |
| **Intelligent Person** | Capable of thought and reasoning |
| **Environment** | Social and physical surroundings |
| **Interaction** | Dynamic relationship between person and environment |

### 2. J.P. Guilford's Definition

!!! quote "Definition by J.P. Guilford"
    "The fact that a man eats, sleeps and works does not define his personality, rather his personality is defined by **what he eats, how he sleeps and what is distinctive about his work pattern.**"
    
    "**Individuality or uniqueness** characterises one's personality. The **consistent and characteristic ways of functioning** of an individual reveals his personality."

| Key Element | Explanation |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Not the Activity** | What you do doesn't define personality |
| **How You Do It** | The distinctive manner matters |
| **Individuality** | Uniqueness is central |
| **Consistency** | Stable patterns of functioning |
| **Characteristic Ways** | Typical behavioral styles |

!!! example "Example"
    - Not *that* you eat → But *what* and *how* you eat
    - Not *that* you work → But *what is distinctive* about your work pattern
    - Not *that* you sleep → But *how* you sleep

### 3. G.W. Allport's Definition (Most Comprehensive)

!!! quote "Definition by G.W. Allport"
    "**Personality is a dynamic organisation within the individual of those psycho-physical systems that determine his characteristic behaviour and thought.**"

!!! note "Key Points 📌"
    Allport's definition is considered **comprehensive** because it recognizes three important values:
    
    1. **Wholeness** of personality
    2. **Adjustment** capacity
    3. **Distinctiveness** of man's personality

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Dynamic** | Active, changing, not static |
| **Organisation** | Structured, integrated whole |
| **Psycho-physical systems** | Mind-body connection |
| **Characteristic** | Typical, distinctive |
| **Behaviour and Thought** | Both actions and cognition |
