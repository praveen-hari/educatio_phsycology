## 📜 Kolesnik's Summary

!!! quote "W.B. Kolesnik's View"
    "The purpose of educational psychology is **NOT** to give specific, definitive answers to questions about methods of teaching or techniques of dealing with children, **NOT** to arm the teacher in advance with pre-packaged solutions to the many practical problems that he is likely to encounter in the classroom.
    
    Its purpose, rather, is to **introduce him to psychological theories and research findings** about learners and the learning process, and to a **method of thinking psychologically**, that may help him **answer his own questions**, **reach his own conclusions** and **solve his own problems**."
