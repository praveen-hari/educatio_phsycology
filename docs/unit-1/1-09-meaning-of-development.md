# 1:09 Meaning of the term 'Development'

!!! abstract "Section Overview"
    This section defines **Development** as overall changes in shape, form, or structure resulting in improved working or functioning, emphasizing its qualitative nature. It also covers the **characteristics of development** (1:09:1).

---

## 📖 Definition of Development

!!! quote "Definition"
    **Development** implies overall changes in **shape, form or structure** resulting in **improved working or functioning**. It indicates the changes in the **quality or character** rather than in quantitative aspects.

```

!!! note "Key Points 📌"
    **Development is the result of:**
    
    1. **Growth** - Physical increase
    2. **Maturation** - Natural unfolding
    3. **Learning** - Experience-based change

## 📊 Growth vs Development Overview

| Aspect | Growth | Development |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Nature** | Quantitative | Qualitative |
| **Focus** | Size, weight, height | Shape, form, function |
| **Outcome** | Increase | Improved functioning |
| **Measurement** | Objective | Through observation |

# 1:09:1 Characteristics of 'Development'

## 📋 Eleven Characteristics of Development

### 1) Progressive, Directional, and Sequential

!!! info "Characteristic 1"
    Development is **progressive**: series of changes occur in an **orderly, predictable pattern** as a result of maturation and experience.
    
    Development is **'directional'** and **'sequential'**.

    B --> C["Stage 3"]
    C --> D["Stage 4"]
    
    style A fill:#ffcdd2
    style B fill:#fff9c4
    style C fill:#c8e6c9
    style D fill:#bbdefb
```

### 2) Continuous

!!! info "Characteristic 2"
    Development is **continuous in all areas of mental activity**. It **does not stop with puberty** as in the case of growth.

| Growth | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| Stops at puberty/maturity | Continues throughout life |

### 3) Goal-oriented (Adaptation)

!!! info "Characteristic 3"
    The **goal of development** is to enable the individual to **adapt to the environment** in which he lives.
    
    **Development results in improved functioning of the individual.**

### 4) Complex and Integrative

!!! info "Characteristic 4"
    Development is a **complex process** of integrating many **structures and functions**.

### 5) Multi-dimensional with Individual Differences

!!! info "Characteristic 5"
    Development is of **many aspects**:
    
    - Physical
    - Emotional
    - Intellectual
    - Social
    - Moral
    
    **Individual differences** are seen in the different aspects of development.

        I["Intellectual"]
        S["Social"]
        M["Moral"]
    end
```

### 6) Spiral (Not Linear) - Non-uniform Rate

!!! info "Characteristic 6"
    Rate of development is **NOT uniform** throughout the life span.
    
    The child makes **advancement** during a particular period and takes **rest** in the next following period to **consolidate** his development. In advancing, he **turns back** and then **moves forward** again like a **spiral**.

!!! note "Key Points 📌"
    Development is **SPIRAL** and **NOT LINEAR**.

    style B fill:#fff9c4
    style C fill:#ffcdd2
    style D fill:#c8e6c9
    style E fill:#c8e6c9
```

### 7) Influenced by Maturation and Learning

!!! info "Characteristic 7"
    Development is influenced by:
    
    | Factor | Role |
    |--------|------|
    | **Maturation** | Natural unfolding of abilities |
    | **Learning** | Experience-based changes |

### 8) Environment-related

!!! info "Characteristic 8"
    Development is very much **related to one's environment**.
    
    **Stimulating environment helps an individual to develop many skills.**

### 9) Based on Modelling

!!! info "Characteristic 9"
    Development is based on **modelling** the parents, teachers and other elder members.

### 10) Cannot be Measured Directly

!!! info "Characteristic 10"
    Since development is **qualitative in nature**, it **cannot be measured directly**.
    
    It could be **assessed through keen observation** in behavioural situations.

| Growth | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| Measured directly | Assessed through observation |
| Use scales, tapes | Watch behaviour |

### 11) Possible Without Growth

!!! info "Characteristic 11"
    **Development is possible even without growth.**
    
    **Example**: Even short-statured people may exhibit **strong physical functioning**.

## 📝 Quick Revision Table

| Aspect | Key Point |
|--------|-----------|
| **Definition** | Overall change in shape, form, structure → improved functioning |
| **Nature** | Qualitative |
| **Result of** | Growth + Maturation + Learning |
| **Duration** | Continuous throughout life |
| **Pattern** | Spiral, not linear |
| **Measurement** | Through observation, not direct measurement |

> **Bridge →** Having understood both Growth and Development separately, the next section provides a detailed **comparison** between these two concepts.

---

!!! tip "Exam Tip 📝"
    The key distinction is: **Growth is quantitative** (measurable), **Development is qualitative** (observable). Remember that development follows a **spiral pattern**, not linear - this is a frequently tested concept.
