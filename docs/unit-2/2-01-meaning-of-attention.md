# 2:01 Meaning of Attention

!!! abstract "Section Overview"
    This section explores the concept of **attention** as a mental process, distinguishing it from a mere faculty of mind. It introduces the relationship between attention and consciousness, and provides a formal definition of 'attending'.

## 🧠 Understanding Attention as a Process

Modern psychologists, who believe in the **integrated functioning of the mind**, do not consider 'attention' as an independent faculty or unique power of mind.

!!! note "Key Points 📌"
    - Attention is a **process** or an **activity** of the mind
    - It is better to speak of **'attending'** rather than 'attention'
    - Both terms can be used synonymously once we understand it as an ongoing process

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Field of Consciousness** | The entire range of what we are aware of at any moment |
| **Field of Attention** | Only a few selected items from consciousness |
| **William James's Insight** | Field of attention and consciousness are **not identical** |

!!! info "Information"
    **Gestalt Psychologists** use the terms:
    
    - **Figure** → corresponds to **Focus** (attended stimuli)
    - **Ground** → corresponds to **Margin** (unattended stimuli)

### Dynamic Nature

The **focus and margin alternate**:

- Stimulus now in focus may **drift to the margin**
- Stimulus earlier in the margin may **move to focus**
- This creates a constant **shifting of attention**

## 🎭 Three Dimensions of Attention

Attention involves **cognitive**, **affective**, and **conative** aspects:

        COG["🧠 COGNITIVE\n(Mental selectivity)"]
        AFF["❤️ AFFECTIVE\n(Emotion related)"]
        CON["🏃 CONATIVE\n(Motor activity related)"]
    end

!!! tip "Exam Tip 📝"
    Remember the **focus-margin** or **figure-ground** relationship. A common question asks you to define attention with reference to consciousness. Always mention that attention is a **selective process** and not the entire field of consciousness.

---

!!! example "Example"
    When sitting in a classroom:
    
    - **Focus**: Teacher's explanation of a concept
    - **Margin**: Sound of fan, classmates whispering, light from window
    
    The focus can shift if the fan suddenly stops (change attracts attention), moving the fan sound from margin to focus temporarily.
