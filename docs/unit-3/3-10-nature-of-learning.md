## 📊 Detailed Analysis of Each Characteristic

### 1. Learning is Universal

!!! quote "Characteristic"
    Learning is **universal**. **All living beings learn**.

---

### 2. Learning is Continuous

!!! quote "Characteristic"
    Learning is **continuous**; it is a perpetual activity that takes place from **'womb to tomb'**.

---

### 3. Learning Results in Improved Performance

!!! quote "Characteristic"
    Learning results in **improved performance**.

---

### 4. Learning is Purposive

!!! quote "Characteristic"
    Learning is **purposive**. A child's learning in and out of school is closely linked up with its **goals**, **purposes**, and **satisfactions**.

!!! note "Key Points 📌"
    **Nobody learns anything without a purpose.**

---

### 5. Learning is Multiple and Integrative

!!! quote "Characteristic"
    Learning is **multiple** and **integrative**.

#### Different Kinds of Learning

For research purposes, psychologists distinguish different kinds of learning:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Verbal learning** | Learning through words and language |
| **Perceptual learning** | Learning through perception |
| **Motor learning** | Learning physical skills |
| **Conceptual learning** | Learning concepts and ideas |
| **Problem-solving** | Learning to solve problems |
| **Emotional learning** | Learning attitudes and feelings |

!!! warning "Important Note"
    These distinctions, though useful, are **artificial**. In reality, different types of learning occur **simultaneously and integratively**.

#### Example: Learning Shorthand

A girl who learns shorthand does not learn a motor skill only. She also learns:

| Learning Type | What is Learned |
|---------------|-----------------|
| **Motor learning** | Physical movements for writing |
| **Verbal learning** | Arbitrary relationships between symbols |
| **Associative learning** | How to make and apply symbols |
| **Emotional learning** | Attitudes about shorthand, commercial world, and herself |

    S --> A[Associative<br/>Making & applying symbols]
    S --> E[Emotional<br/>Attitudes]
    
    M --> I[INTEGRATED<br/>LEARNING]
    V --> I
    A --> I
    E --> I

### 6. Learning is Contingent Upon Experience

!!! quote "Characteristic"
    Learning is **contingent upon experience**.

!!! note "Key Points 📌"
    - Learning is **not something to be given**; it is to be **gained by self-experience**
    - A person's knowledge or learning is the **result of that person's experience**

## 📊 Summary Table

| # | Characteristic | Key Phrase |
|---|----------------|------------|
| 1 | **Universal** | All living beings |
| 2 | **Continuous** | Womb to tomb |
| 3 | **Improved performance** | Better outcomes |
| 4 | **Purposive** | Goals and purposes |
| 5 | **Multiple and Integrative** | Different types combined |
| 6 | **Contingent upon experience** | Self-gained |
