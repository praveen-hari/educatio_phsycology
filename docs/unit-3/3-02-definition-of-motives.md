# 3:02 Definition of Motives

!!! abstract "Section Overview"
    This section defines **motives** as biological, social, and learned factors that initiate, sustain, and stop goal-directed behaviour, explaining how motives create disequilibrium and tension that drive organisms to action.

## 📋 What are Motives?

!!! quote "Definition"
    **Motives** generally refer to **biological**, **social**, and **learned factors** that **initiate**, **sustain**, and **stop** goal-directed behaviour of organisms.

### Key Characteristics

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Nature** | May be physiological or psychological |
| **Origin** | Act from within the organism |
| **Etymology** | Latin root means **'to move'** or **'to impel'** |
| **Result** | Organism exhibits specific behaviour to reach the goal |

!!! note "Key Points 📌"
    - A motive creates a state of **disequilibrium** or **tension** within the organism
    - This initiates and sustains a particular type of activity
    - Activity leads to **restoration of equilibrium** by attaining the goal
    - **'Disequilibrium'** and **'tension'** are basic to motivation

## 🔍 Observing Motives

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Direct observation** | Motives do not lend themselves to direct observation |
| **Inference** | They are inferred from manifest behaviour or verbal reports |
| **Example** | A student's intensive study reveals achievement motive |
| **Prediction** | Motives enable us to predict behaviour |

!!! example "Example"
    A student **plunging into intensive study** reveals his **motive for achievement**. By understanding this motive, we can **predict** that the student will likely engage in similar studious behaviour in the future.
