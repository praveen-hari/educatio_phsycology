---

### 5. Intelligence

!!! note "Key Points 📌"
    The **level of intelligence** of a person determines:
    
    | Aspect | Influence |
    |--------|-----------|
    | **Learning method** | How one learns |
    | **Rate of learning** | Speed of acquisition |
    | **Nature of material** | Type of content learned |
    | **Amount learned** | Quantity mastered |

---

### 6. Attention and Environment

!!! note "Key Points 📌"
    - **Attention** is a **pre-requisite** for learning
    - A **warm, pleasant atmosphere** is highly helpful in learning

---

### 7. Initial Success

!!! note "Key Points 📌"
    Getting **success initially** as one starts learning **induces further learning**.

---

### 8. Audio-Visual Aids

!!! note "Key Points 📌"

    **Distributed practice** enhances the **effectiveness of learning**.

---

### 13. Perception

!!! note "Key Points 📌"
    Learning based on **perception** makes the lesson or the task **much easier**.

!!! quote "Definition"
    **Perceptual learning** refers to understanding the **relations between different elements** in the learning task which leads to **meaningful learning**.

---

### 14. Correlation with Past Knowledge

!!! note "Key Points 📌"
    Ability to **correlate the present learning** with one's **past knowledge** leads to **meaningful learning**.

---

### 15. Rewards and Punishments

!!! note "Key Points 📌"
