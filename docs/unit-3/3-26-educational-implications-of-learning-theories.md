### 3. Operant Conditioning (Skinner)

!!! success "Educational Implications"
    
    | Theory Principle | Classroom Application |
    |-----------------|----------------------|
    | **Positive reinforcement** | Praise, rewards for good performance |
    | **Negative reinforcement** | Remove unpleasant conditions for good behavior |
    | **Shaping** | Break complex tasks into smaller steps |
    | **Immediate reinforcement** | Provide quick feedback |
    | **Programmed instruction** | Self-paced learning materials |

### 4. Cognitive Development (Piaget)

!!! success "Educational Implications"
    
    | Theory Principle | Classroom Application |
    |-----------------|----------------------|
    | **Developmental stages** | Match curriculum to cognitive level |
    | **Active learning** | Provide hands-on experiences |
    | **Discovery learning** | Let students explore and discover |
    | **Concrete operations** | Use manipulatives for younger students |
    | **Formal operations** | Introduce abstract concepts for older students |

### 5. Constructivism (Dewey)

!!! success "Educational Implications"
    
    | Theory Principle | Classroom Application |
    |-----------------|----------------------|
    | **Meaning construction** | Students build their own understanding |
    | **Prior knowledge** | Connect new learning to existing knowledge |
    | **Social learning** | Use cooperative learning strategies |
    | **Authentic tasks** | Real-world, meaningful problems |
    | **SOI Model** | Help students Select, Organize, Integrate |

---

### 6. Humanistic Psychology (Rogers, Maslow)

!!! success "Educational Implications"
    
    | Theory Principle | Classroom Application |
    |-----------------|----------------------|
    | **Self-actualization** | Support student potential |
    | **Felt needs** | Address what students find meaningful |
    | **Whole person** | Develop cognitive, affective, social aspects |
    | **Teacher as facilitator** | Guide rather than lecture |
    | **Positive climate** | Create safe, accepting environment |
