# 3:19 Differences Between 'Reinforcement' and 'Feedback'

!!! abstract "Section Overview"

---

## 📋 Definition: Reinforcement

!!! quote "Definition"
    **Reinforcement** refers to strengthening the probability of occurrence of a desired response either by:
    - **Presenting** the organism with a **positive reinforcer** after the operant response is exhibited, OR
    - **Withdrawal** of a **negative reinforcer**

### Examples of Positive Reinforcers

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Food** | Treats, snacks, pellets |
| **Objects** | Toys, prizes |
| **Monetary** | Money, coins |

| Aspect | Reinforcement (Rewards) | Feedback |
|--------|------------------------|----------|
| **Level of Operation** | **Physical level** | **Psychological level** |
| **Nature** | Tangible rewards | Knowledge of results |
| **Examples** | Food, toys, money | Scores, grades, performance information |
| **Suitable for** | **Children and animals** | **Matured adults** |
