# 4:06 Howard Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligence

!!! info "Information"
    **Prof. Howard Gardner** of Harvard University, USA, presented his theory in his book **"Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligence" (1983)**. This theory revolutionized our understanding of human cognitive abilities.

## Gardner's Criticism of Traditional IQ Tests

!!! quote "Definition"
    According to Gardner, **intelligence as measured through IQ tests is narrowly conceived**. Human intelligence is really **broad-based and of many kinds**. Attempting to assess such a wide range of mental abilities by using a single measure called IQ is akin to **"caging an elephant in a glass bottle"**.

## Educational Implications

### Critique of Current Education System

!!! warning "Limitation"
    According to Gardner, our present school system gives importance to promote **only the first two categories** of intelligence (Verbal and Numerical ability, Logical reasoning). It should take equal interest in developing **other types of intelligence** too.

### Current System Problems

| Problem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Narrow Focus** | Only verbal and numerical abilities are emphasized |
| **Labeling** | Children with other talents are labeled as having 'learning disability' |
| **Neglect** | Exceptional skills in other fields don't get due care and recognition |
| **Reason** | Those children lag behind in verbal and numerical abilities |

### Gardner's Recommendations

!!! success "Summary"
    Gardner's Theory insists on bringing **revolutionary changes** in the instructional system.

### Multimodal Classroom Activities

| Intelligence | Recommended Activities |
|--------------|----------------------|
| **Linguistic** | Reading, writing, debates, storytelling |
| **Logical-Mathematical** | Problem-solving, calculations, experiments |
| **Spatial** | Diagrams, maps, visual presentations |
| **Kinesthetic** | Hands-on activities, movement, role-play |
| **Musical** | Songs, rhythm, musical mnemonics |
| **Interpersonal** | Group work, discussions, peer teaching |
| **Intrapersonal** | Reflection journals, self-assessment |
| **Naturalist** | Field trips, nature observation, environmental projects |

## Why Gardner's Theory Matters

!!! note "Key Points 📌"
    - Learning becomes **optimal and joyful** only if learner's potentials are exploited
    - Each student can learn using activities appropriate to their **dominant intelligence type**
    - Experts in fine arts, music, dance, sports, business could emerge in society
    - Today, Gardner's Theory is becoming **quite popular** among educationalists, psychologists, and philosophers worldwide

## Quick Comparison: IQ Tests vs Multiple Intelligence

| Aspect | Traditional IQ Tests | Gardner's Multiple Intelligence |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Intelligences Measured** | 2 (Linguistic, Logical-Mathematical) | 8 types |
| **View of Intelligence** | Narrow, fixed | Broad, diverse |
| **Recognition** | Academic abilities only | All human abilities |
| **Approach** | Single measure (IQ score) | Multiple assessments |
| **Educational Impact** | Limited curriculum focus | Diverse, multimodal instruction |

!!! tip "Exam Tip 📝"
    **Mnemonic for 8 Intelligences**: **L**inguistic, **L**ogical-Mathematical, **S**patial, **K**inesthetic, **M**usical, **I**nterpersonal, **I**ntrapersonal, **N**aturalist = **"LL-SKMI-IN"** or remember as **"2 L's, SKMI, IN"**

!!! success "Summary"
    - Gardner proposed **8 types of intelligence** in his 1983 book
    - Only **2 types** (Linguistic and Logical-Mathematical) are measured by traditional IQ tests
    - Educational system should promote **all 8 types** equally
    - Classroom instruction should be **manifold and multimodal**
    - This theory is gaining **worldwide popularity** among educators
