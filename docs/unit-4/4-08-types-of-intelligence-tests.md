## 4:08:1 Individual and Group Tests

### Individual Tests

!!! quote "Definition"
    **Individual tests** of intelligence can be used to test **only one subject at a time**. If many are to be tested, each has to be done separately and individually.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Administration** | One subject at a time |
| **Time Required** | Enormous expenditure of time and energy |
| **Limitation** | May penalize bright but shy/nervous children |
| **Issue** | Children may not display best when directly facing tester |

### Group Tests

!!! quote "Definition"
    **Group tests** were developed to overcome the limitations of individual testing. They are **paper and pencil tests** with a time limit for completion.

### Historical Development of Group Tests

```

### Army Tests

| Test | Target Population | Features |
|------|------------------|----------|
| **Army Alpha** | Those who knew English | Language-based |
| **Army Beta** | Those not versed in English | Digits and diagrams; non-verbal; subjects mark next to appropriate picture/diagram |

### Sample Types of Group Test Items

| No. | Item Type | Description |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| i | Vocabulary items | Word knowledge |
| ii | Word analogies | Relationships between words |
| iii | Sentence completion | Fill in missing parts |
| iv | Mathematical reasoning | Problem-solving with numbers |
| v | Number series | Pattern recognition in sequences |
| vi | Classification | Grouping similar items |
| vii | Following directions | Comprehension of instructions |
| viii | Picture arrangement | Sequencing visual materials |
| ix | Memory for designs | Recall of visual patterns |
| x | Absurdities test | Identifying illogical elements |
| xi | Common sense tests | Practical reasoning |
| xii | Digit-symbol substitution | Coding tasks |
| xiii | Paper and pencil mazes | Spatial navigation |

!!! note "Key Points 📌"
    - **Younger age groups**: Items use objects, pictures, and concrete items
    - **Older age groups**: Words and abstractions become more stressed

### 4:08:1:01 Advantages of Group Tests of Intelligence

| Advantage | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Economical** | Many can be tested at the same time |
| **Reduces Shyness** | Permits shy and socially withdrawn subjects to display their best |
| **Easy Administration** | Comparatively simple to administer |
| **Quick Scoring** | Stencil scoring and mechanical devices help in quick, accurate scoring |

        A[Economical - Test Many at Once]
        B[Shy Students Perform Better]
        C[Easy to Administer]
        D[Quick & Accurate Scoring]
    end
```

### 4:08:1:02 Limitations of Group Tests of Intelligence

| Limitation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Limited Depth** | Not useful for in-depth study of single person's intelligence |
| **Negative Attitudes** | Resemble school exams; children with negative exam attitudes may transfer these |
| **Time Pressure** | Time limit brings pressure and tension on testees |
| **Reading Difficulties** | Children with reading difficulties may have problems comprehending; scores may be lower than actual ability |

!!! warning "Limitation"
    Group tests are useful when intelligence of **many persons** has to be **roughly measured** for some practical purpose in a **short period of time**.

---

## 4:08:2 Verbal and Performance Tests

### Early Verbal Tests

!!! info "Information"
    The early tests of intelligence were **verbal or linguistic** in nature, requiring knowledge of the test language.

### Disadvantages of Verbal Tests

| Problem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Misunderstanding** | Wrong responses due to language misunderstanding, not lack of intelligence |
| **Language Proficiency Bias** | Those with language proficiency (but not higher mental abilities) may score high |
| **Cannot Test** | Language non-knowers, very young children, tribal/aboriginals, sensory handicapped |

### Performance Tests

!!! quote "Definition"
    **Performance tests** of intelligence make use of **concrete objects** with which the subject has to do something. They assess behavior arising out of intelligence through standardized tasks using ordinary materials.

!!! note "Key Points 📌"
    - **Performance tests are non-verbal**; but **all non-verbal tests need not be performance tests**
    - Non-verbal tests (matrices, mazes) use symbols and diagrams
    - Performance tests use concrete objects like cubes, beads, etc.

### Popular Performance Tests

| Test | Developer |
|------|-----------|
| Performance Tests | Pinter and Patterson |
| Performance Tests | Collins and Draver |
| **Bhatia's Tests** | For Indian children |

### Bhatia's Tests of Intelligence (For Indian Children)

| No. | Sub-test | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| i | **Koh's Block Design test** | Arranging colored blocks to match patterns |
| ii | **Alexander's Pass Along test** | Moving pieces to achieve goal |
| iii | **Pattern-Drawing test** | Reproducing visual patterns |
| iv | **Immediate Memory test for digits** | Recalling number sequences |
| v | **Picture Construction test** | Assembling picture parts |

### Scoring Performance Tests

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|--------------|
| **Time taken** | Speed of completion |
| **Errors committed** | Mistakes during performance |
| **MA determination** | From table of norms provided with test battery |

### 4:08:2:01 When to Use Performance Tests?

!!! note "Key Points 📌"
    Results from verbal and performance tests correlate only to a **moderate extent**, so performance tests **cannot be used as good substitutes** for verbal tests.

### Appropriate Use of Performance Tests

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph VERBAL["Use Verbal Tests For"]
        V1[Those with linguistic ability]
        V2[General population]
        V3[Academic assessment]
    end
    
    subgraph PERFORMANCE["Use Performance Tests For"]
        P1[No/Poor linguistic ability]
        P2[Very young children]
        P3[Tribal/Aboriginals]
        P4[Sensory handicapped]
    end
    
    COMBO["For Complete Understanding"] --> VERBAL
    COMBO --> PERFORMANCE
```

| Situation | Recommended Test |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Sufficient linguistic ability | Verbal + Performance (for complete understanding) |
| No/Poor linguistic ability | Performance tests |
| Very young children | Performance tests |
| Tribal/Aboriginals | Performance tests |
| Sensory handicapped | Performance tests |

### 4:08:2:02 Limitations of Performance Tests

| No. | Limitation |
|-----|------------|
| 1 | Administering and interpreting requires **specially trained personnel** |
| 2 | Little positive correlation between verbal and performance test scores |
| 3 | **Not as reliable as verbal tests** |
| 4 | Should not be used as substitutes for verbal tests |
| 5 | **Cannot predict scholastic achievement** |
| 6 | Materials are **costly** |
| 7 | Many factors **other than intelligence** seem to help success |
| 8 | **Cannot be used as group tests** |
| 9 | Materials similar to sophisticated toys favor higher socio-economic groups |

!!! warning "Limitation"
    Children from higher socio-economic groups may score high due to **familiarity with materials** (similar to sophisticated toys), though they may not have such high mental ability.

## Comparison Summary

### Individual vs Group Tests

| Aspect | Individual Tests | Group Tests |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Administration** | One at a time | Many at once |
| **Time** | Time-consuming | Economical |
| **Depth** | In-depth study possible | Rough measurement |
| **Shy students** | May underperform | Can perform better |
| **Scoring** | More detailed | Quick, standardized |

### Verbal vs Performance Tests

| Aspect | Verbal Tests | Performance Tests |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **Content** | Language-based | Concrete objects |
| **Requirement** | Language knowledge | No language needed |
| **Reliability** | More reliable | Less reliable |
| **Prediction** | Predicts academic success | Cannot predict scholastic achievement |
| **Administration** | Individual or group | Individual only |
| **Cost** | Lower cost | Costly materials |

---

!!! success "Summary"
    - Tests classified by **administration** (Individual/Group) and **content** (Verbal/Non-verbal/Performance)
    - **Individual tests**: Detailed but time-consuming; may intimidate shy students
    - **Group tests**: Economical, quick scoring; but time pressure and reading issues
    - **Verbal tests**: Require language knowledge; more reliable for predicting academic success
    - **Performance tests**: For those without language ability; use concrete objects; cannot predict scholastic achievement
