## 4:05:1 Unitary Theory or Monarchic Theory

!!! quote "Definition"
    This theory holds that **intelligence consists of an all-pervasive capacity**. If one has a fund of intelligence, he can utilize it in any area of life.

### Proponents
- **Binet**
- **Terman**
- Other classical psychologists

### Key Concepts

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core Principle** | Intelligence is a single, unified capacity |
| **Application** | Intelligence stamps itself in all thinking and actions |
| **Assumption** | Same intelligence applies to all activities |

### Criticisms

!!! warning "Limitation"
    - A genius mathematical professor may be absent-minded or socially ill-adjusted
    - Different tests in an intelligence battery are not highly correlated
    - The unifactor approach is **too simple**; a **complex model** is needed

## 4:05:2 Spearman's Two-Factor Theory

!!! quote "Definition"
    **Spearman** proposed that every different mental ability involves a **general factor (G)**, which it shares with all other mental activities, and a **specific factor (S)**, which it shares with none.

### Year: 1904

### The Two Factors

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph GFACTOR["G Factor (General)"]
        G1[Largely Innate]
        G2[Accounts for success in ALL activities]
        G3[Constant for an individual]
        G4[Differs between individuals]
        G5[Approximates to 'common sense']
    end
    
    subgraph SFACTOR["S Factor (Specific)"]
        S1[Essentially Learned]
        S2[Specific to particular fields]
        S3[Different for different activities]
        S4[Determines specialized field success]
    end
```

| Factor | Nature | Characteristics | Role |
|--------|--------|-----------------|------|
| **G Factor** | Innate (mostly) | Constant for individual, varies between individuals | Success in all activities |
| **S Factor** | Learned | Specific to each activity | Success in specialized fields |

### Performance Prediction

!!! note "Key Points 📌"
    Performance in any situation is predicted by the **amount of share of 'G' and 'S'** in different intellectual activities.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    G[G Factor] --> P1[Math Performance]
    G --> P2[Language Performance]
    G --> P3[Science Performance]

    S2[S-Language] --> P2
    S3[S-Science] --> P3
    
    style G fill:#4caf50,stroke:#2e7d32,color:#fff
```

### Example
- Persons good in **natural sciences** may be poor in **social sciences**
- Those who excel in **mathematics** may be poor in **language**

!!! tip "Exam Tip 📝"
    Remember: **G = General (Innate, Common to all)** and **S = Specific (Learned, Unique to each)**

---

## 4:05:3 Thorndike's Multifactor Theory

!!! quote "Definition"
    **Thorndike** proposed that intelligence is nothing more than a convenient name for an **almost infinite number of actual or potential specific connections** between stimuli and responses.

### Also Known As: **Atomistic Theory of Intelligence**

### Key Principles

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Approach** | Associationist (opposed Unifactor theory) |
| **Core Idea** | Specific stimuli → Specific responses |
| **Source of Differences** | Number of connections in neurological system |
| **Structure** | Multitude of separate factors/elements, each a minute ability |

### Mental Act Explanation

```

### Four Attributes of Intelligence (Thorndike)

| Attribute | Description | Test Representation |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Level** | Difficulty of task that can be solved | Items arranged by increasing difficulty |
| **Range** | Number of tasks at any given difficulty level | Items of equal difficulty |
| **Area** | Total number of situations at each level one can respond to | Summation of all ranges |
| **Speed** | Rapidity of response to items | Time taken to complete |

!!! note "Key Points 📌"
    - **Level** = Height on ladder of difficulty
    - **Range** = Breadth of experience and opportunity to learn
    - **Area** = Summation of all ranges at each level
    - **Speed** = Positively related to altitude/level

### Relationship Among Attributes

```mermaid

    AREA[Area - Total Responses] --> TEST[Intelligence Test]
    SPEED[Speed - Rapidity] --> TEST
    
    LEVEL -.->|"Positively Related"| SPEED
```

!!! tip "Exam Tip 📝"
    Every intelligence test consists of these **four attributes**: Level (difficulty), Range (breadth), Area (total), Speed (rapidity).

## 4:05:4 Thurstone's Group-Factor Theory

!!! quote "Definition"
    According to the **group-factor theory**, intelligent activity is not an expression of innumerable highly specific factors (Thorndike) nor primarily of a general factor (Spearman). Instead, certain mental operations have a **'primary' factor** in common, giving them psychological and functional unity.

### Advocates: **Thurstone and Associates**

## 4:05:5 Guilford's Structure of Intellect (SI Model)

!!! quote "Definition"
    The **Structure of Intellect model** is the result of factor analysis conducted by **Guilford and associates** at the University of South California in **1966**. Guilford suggests that mind is composed of at least **three major dimensions**: Operations, Contents, and Products.

### The Three Dimensions

### Key Points About Guilford's Theory

!!! note "Key Points 📌"
    - Guilford does **NOT** agree with the idea of fixed amount of intelligence
    - Development of intellectual skill depends on **practice** (like any other skill)
    - Takes into account **inter-personal skills** and **social behavior**
    - Refers to **dynamic cluster of skills** that can always be improved

### 4:05:5:01 Educational Implications of Guilford's SI Model

| Application | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Learning Outcomes** | Useful in identifying and defining specific learning outcomes |
| **Divergent Thinking** | Elements relating to convergent and divergent thinking stimulated considerable interest |
| **High Divergent Thinkers** | High in creativity; produce new forms of responses |
| **High IQ People** | Tend to focus on socially acceptable responses |

!!! tip "Exam Tip 📝"
    **Guilford's formula**: 6 Operations × 5 Contents × 6 Products = **180 Mental Abilities**

| Theory | Proponent | Structure | Key Concept |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Unitary** | Binet, Terman | Single capacity | One intelligence for all |
| **Two-Factor** | Spearman | G + S factors | General + Specific |
| **Multifactor** | Thorndike | Infinite connections | Stimulus-Response bonds |
| **Group-Factor** | Thurstone | 7 PMAs | Primary Mental Abilities |
| **Structure of Intellect** | Guilford | 180 abilities | Operations × Contents × Products |

!!! success "Summary"
    - **Unitary Theory**: Intelligence as single capacity (too simple)
    - **Spearman's Two-Factor**: G (general) + S (specific) factors
    - **Thorndike's Multifactor**: Infinite S-R connections; 4 attributes (Level, Range, Area, Speed)
    - **Thurstone's Group-Factor**: 7 Primary Mental Abilities
    - **Guilford's SI Model**: 180 abilities (6 Operations × 5 Contents × 6 Products)
