# Unit IV: Intelligence and Creativity

## 📋 Abstract

!!! abstract "Unit Overview"
    This unit comprehensively explores **Intelligence and Creativity** - two fundamental cognitive constructs in educational psychology. It covers the meaning, definitions, and measurement of intelligence, various theories proposed by psychologists like Spearman, Thorndike, Thurstone, and Guilford, along with Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligence. The unit also delves into creativity, examining its characteristics, stages in the creative process, methods of identifying creative children, and strategies for fostering creativity in educational settings.
