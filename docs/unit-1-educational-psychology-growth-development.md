## 📋 Abstract

!!! abstract "Unit Overview"
    This foundational unit introduces **Educational Psychology** as a discipline and explores **Human Growth and Development**. It traces the historical evolution of psychology from philosophy to a scientific discipline, defines educational psychology and its scope, and distinguishes between growth, development, and maturation. The unit comprehensively covers the dimensions and phases of human development from infancy through adolescence, including physical, intellectual, emotional, social, and moral development. Special emphasis is placed on understanding adolescence - its characteristics, problems, and ways to help adolescents. The concept of **Developmental Tasks** and their educational implications are also discussed.

## 1:01 Definition of 'Psychology'

!!! quote "Definition"
    **Psychology** is "a science that systematically studies and attempts to explain observable behaviour and its relationship to unseen 'mental' processes (experiences) that go on inside the organism and to external events in the environment."

The goals of psychology are **description, explanation, prediction and control** of behaviour including subjective experiences.

### 1:01:1 Etymology of Psychology

| Greek Word | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| **Psyche** | Soul |
| **Logus** | Science/Knowledge |

!!! note "Key Points 📌"
    - **Literal meaning**: Science of the Soul (now given up)
    - **Modern definition**: Science of Behaviour
    - **Behaviour includes**: Observable overt activities + Covert mental activities

### 1:01:2 Goals of Psychology

!!! example "Example"
    If a student fails in monthly math tests, psychology helps:
    
    - **Predict**: He will likely fail in annual exams
    - **Explain**: Lack of interest, motivation, negative attitude
    - **Control**: Plan behavior changes to improve performance

## 1:03 Definition of Educational Psychology

!!! quote "Definition"
    **Educational Psychology** is defined as that branch of psychology which is concerned with **psychological researches as applied to any or all aspects of educational processes and practices**. It is related to problems like learning, teaching, and training.

!!! quote "Definition by Kolesnik"
    Educational Psychology tries to solve different problems faced in the educative process by **applying principles and laws of psychology** in educational situations, so as to make education more **effective and efficient**.

!!! quote "Definition by Redden"
    Education is the deliberate process of **modifying one's behaviour** (knowledge, skills, and attitude) through a sequence of systematically planned experiences to achieve predetermined goals.

### 1:03:1 Educational Psychology Formula

```
Educational Psychology = Science of modifying learner's behaviour 
                       → To refine personality 
                       → To create efficient and responsible citizen
```

!!! note "Key Points 📌"
    - **Classroom** is the laboratory for educational psychologists
    - Psychology is the **science of behaviour**
    - Education is the process of **modifying behaviour**
    - Educational Psychology combines both

> **Bridge →** What is the nature and scope of Educational Psychology?

    - Nature of learning
    - Growth of human personality
    - Differences between individuals
    - Study of person in relation to society

!!! quote "Kolesnik's Purpose of Educational Psychology"
    "The purpose is NOT to give specific, definitive answers... Its purpose is to introduce teachers to psychological theories and research findings about learners and the learning process, and to a method of **thinking psychologically**, that may help teachers answer their own questions, reach their own conclusions, and solve their own problems."

> **Bridge →** Now let's understand the fundamental concepts of Growth and Development.

---

## 1:08 Meaning of the term 'Growth'

!!! quote "Definition"
    **Growth** is used purely in the **physical sense**. It generally refers to increase in **size, length, height, and weight**. Changes in the **quantitative aspects**, which could be objectively observed and measured, come into the domain of growth. Growth is one of the components of the developmental process. In a sense, development in its quantitative aspect is termed as growth.

### 1:08:1 Characteristics of 'Growth'

| # | Characteristic |
|---|----------------|
| 1 | Refers to increase by becoming **larger and heavier** |
| 2 | **Quantitative**, additive, augmental |
| 3 | **Objectively observable** and measurable |
| 4 | **Stops** when maturity is obtained |
| 5 | May or may not bring development (e.g., becoming fat) |
| 6 | Rate is **not uniform** - rapid in early years, slows in later infancy, spurts at puberty |
| 7 | Wide **individual differences** exist |
| 8 | Different **body parts grow at different rates** |

---

## 1:09 Meaning of the term 'Development'

!!! quote "Definition"
    **Development** implies overall changes in **shape, form or structure** resulting in **improved working or functioning**. It indicates the changes in the **quality or character** rather than in quantitative aspects. Development is the result of growth, maturation and learning.

### 1:09:1 Formula

```
Development = Growth + Maturation + Learning
```

### 1:09:2 Characteristics of 'Development'

| # | Characteristic |
|---|----------------|
| 1 | **Progressive** - orderly, predictable pattern; directional and sequential |
| 2 | **Continuous** - doesn't stop at puberty (unlike growth) |
| 3 | Goal is **adaptation** to environment; improved functioning |
| 4 | **Complex process** - integrating many structures and functions |
| 5 | **Multi-dimensional** - physical, emotional, intellectual, social, moral |
| 6 | Rate is **not uniform** - spiral (advances, consolidates, then advances again) |
| 7 | Influenced by **maturation and learning** |
| 8 | Related to **environment** - stimulating environment helps |
| 9 | Based on **modelling** parents, teachers, elders |
| 10 | **Cannot be measured directly** - assessed through observation |
| 11 | **Possible without growth** - short people can have strong functioning |

!!! tip "Exam Tip 📝"
    Development is **SPIRAL, not linear** - the child advances, consolidates, then moves forward again.

---

## 1:10 Comparison between 'Growth' and 'Development'

| Aspect | Growth | Development |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Nature** | Quantitative (increase, enlargement) | Both quantitative AND qualitative (improved functioning) |
| **Measurement** | Objectively observable and measurable | Cannot be measured directly; assessed through observation |
| **Duration** | Stops after maturation | Continuous; doesn't stop after puberty |
| **Scope** | One aspect of development | Complex and many-sided |
| **Focus** | Changes in different body parts | Changes in organism as a whole |
| **Direction** | Not directional | Progressive and sequential |
| **Rate** | Not uniform across body parts | Not uniform across life span |
| **Individual differences** | Exist in growth | Exist in different aspects (physical, social, emotional, intellectual) |
| **Learning influence** | Not much affected | Greatly affected by learning and experience |
| **Relationship** | May or may not lead to development | Development in one aspect promotes development in others (integrative) |

---

## 1:11 Meaning of Maturation

!!! quote "Definition"
    **Maturation** is a natural process. It is the growth which takes place within the individual. Maturational changes are the result of **unfolding and ripening of inherited traits** and are relatively **independent of activity, practice, or experience**.

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Growth** | Increase in size, length, height, weight (quantitative) |
| **Maturation** | Maximum limit of growth; growth stops here |
| **Development** | Continuous throughout life; before AND after maturation |

!!! note "Key Points 📌"
    - **Growth and Maturation**: Largely determined by **heredity**
    - **Development**: Significantly influenced by **environment**
    - Growth **stops** after maturation; Development **continues** throughout life
