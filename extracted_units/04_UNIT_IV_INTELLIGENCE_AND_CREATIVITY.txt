4:01 Meaning of Intelligence

Psychologists have suggested various points of view
regarding the nature of intelligence. All the definitions
can be classified under the following three groups:

_ i) Ability for adjustment or adaptation: According
to this point of view, intelligence is the general mental
adaptability for new problems and new situations of life.
Thus more intelligent person is one who can more easily
and more extensively vary his behaviour as changing
conditions demand.

ii) Ability to learn : This view point emphasizes the
ability to learn i-e. one’s intelligence is a matter of the

Intelligence and Creativity 157

extent to which he is educable. The more intelligent a
person, ihe more readily and extensively he is able to
learn and enlarge his field of activities and experiences.

ill) Ability to carry on abstract thinking : Here
emphasis is laid on the effective use of concepts and
symbols in dealing with situations, especially presenting
a problem to be solved through the use of verbal and
numerical symbols.

The three categories of definitions of intelligence
stated above are not exclusive of each other but are
inclusive and interdependent on each other. No doubt,
on the surface these categories appear quite different;
but on critical examination it could be found that learning
ability is the basic requisite condition for the other two
aspects of intelligence.

4:02 Definitions of intelligence

1. Studdard speaks of intelligence, as the " ability
to start and sustain, inspite of emotional
interferences, activities that are difficult, novel and
useful in an economical manner”.

2. A very comprekensive and widely accepted
definition of intelligence has been given by Wechsler,
which states “Intelligence is the aggregate or global
capacity of an individual to act purposefully, to think _
rationally and to deal effectively with the
environment”. This definition encompasses all the three
major view points which regard intelligence as-

ee
i) adjustment or adaptation ability
ii) ability to learn
ili) ability to carry on abstract thinking
3. Alfred Binet considers intelligence as involving
such abilities as, "understanding, originality,
persistence and self-criticism".
4:03 Characteristic of an Intelligent Person
: An Intelligent person is one who,
i) learns fast and with ease.

ii) displays good adjustment in behaviour and has
the capacity to solve the problems he
encounters.

iii) is capable of successfully completing even
difficult and complex tasks with high
efficiency and that too economically.

iv) adjusts his behaviour according to the demands
of the goals which he seeks to attain.

v) generaily acts in pursuit of the welfare of the
society.

vi) does not get easily carried away by emotions
but focuses his attention and efforts on the
task in hand by mobilising all his energy and
resources at his command. —

vii) is capable of handling any trying situation and
win over it.

vill) has the ability to analyse any problem
thoroughly.

ix) knows the knack of getting along with others
and bring them around his point of view.

x) British psychologists point out the following two
essential behavioural aspects exhibited by
intelligent persons :

a) Perceive the appropriate relations that exist
among objects or ideas.

b) Apply the relations so perceived to new
situations in life.

4:04 Types of Intelligence ic

Some Psychologists, notably Thorndike believe
that several kinds of intelligence should be distinguished
from each other. According to him intelligence is of three
kinds:

1. Social Intelligence : It refers to the knack of
getting along with people. Socially intelligent
person makes friends easily and understands
human relations. :

2. Mechanical Intelligence : It is the ability to
deal effectively with machines or mechanical
contrivances. ,

3. Abstract intelligence : It is the ability to deal
with symbols (both verbal and numerical),
diagrams, formulae etc.

Prof. Howard Gardener of Harward. university of
U.S.A. in his book "Frames of Mind : The Theory of
Multiple Intelligence” has posted a provisional list of

intelligences which include linguistic and logical skills
(Which |. Q. tests measure), Musical skills, Kinesthetic
skills (exhibited by Surgeons, dancers etc.), Spatial
skills (displayed by Sculptors etc.), Interpersonal skilis
(important for politicians, salesmen etc.) and
Intrapersonal skills (exhibited by planners and
strategists)

4:05 Theories of Intelligence

There are many views regarding what constitutes -

“intelligence”. The different view points expressed by
psychologists regarding the structure and functioning of
intelligence go by the name theories of intelligence.
Important among them are presented below: ,

4:05:1 Unitary Theory or Monarchic Theory

This theory holds that intelligence consists of all
pervasive capacity. Binet, Terman and some other
classical psychologists supported this view. According to
this theory, if one has a fund of intelligence he can utilise
it to any area of his life, the intelligence of a person gets
stamped in all what he thinks and acts. But in our practical
life we see contrary to this. A genial mathematical
professor may be absent minded or socially ill-adjusted.
Further analysis of scores in an intelligence test battery

shows that different tests in the battery are not highly.

correlated. Hence it is suggested that the unifactor
approach is too simple and a complex model.is needed
to explain intelligence satisfactorily.

4:05:2 Spearman's Two-factor Theory .

Spearman proposed his two-factor theory of,
intelligence in 1904. The first-factor was a general.
capacity which was basically a reasoning factor:,
According to this theory every different mental ability
involves a general factor (G), which it shares with all other:
mental activities and.a specific factor (S), which itshares
with none. 'G' factor is largely innate and accounts for
success in all activities. It is constant in the sense that
for any individual it remains the same of all the correlated
activities. It differs from individual to individual,. ,, But
success in any specialised field very much depends on
the concerned specific factor which is essentially jearrit.

‘Thus no person is absolutely uniform in -his mental
‘performance. So persons who are good in natural

sciences are poor in social sciences. Some who excel in
mathematics are poor in language. Thus, performance
in any situation is predicted by the amountdof-share of 'G’
and 'S' in different. intellect activities. ‘This can be
represented as follows:

G : General Factor {approximates to ‘common n sense}
S$: Specific Factors

4:05:3 Thorndike's Multifactor Theory

Thorndike was an associationist and he opposed
the theory of general intelligence (Unifactor theory). He
proposed that there are specific stimuli and. specific
response. Intelligence to him is nothing more than a
convenient name for almost infinite number of actual or
potential specific connections between these stimuli and
responses. Differences in intelligence among people are
due to the number of connections in the neurological
system. According to the theory, intelligence is said to be
“constituted of a multitude of separate factors or elements,
each being a minute element or ability (and hence this
theory is known as atomistic theory of intelligence). A
mental act according to this.theory involves a number of
these minute elements operating together. .|f. any two
tasks are correlated, the degree of correlation is due to
the common:elements involved in the two tasks.

Thorndike distinguished four attributes of
intelligence. They are: i ~

a) Level : This refers to the difficulty of a task that

can be solved. If we think of all test items arranged in a

sequential order of increasing difficulty, then the height
that we can ascend on this ladder of difficulty determine
our level or attitude of intelligence. —

b) Range : This refers to the number of tasks at any

given degree of difficulty that we can solve. Theoretically

an-individual possessing a given level of intelligence.
should be able to solve the whole range of tasks at that

intelligence and Creativity 162

level. ‘Range’ is determined not only by ‘evel’ but also
by the breadth of experience and. by opportunity to learn.
In intelligence tests, range is represented by items of
equal difficulty. ,

c) Area: it refers to the total number of situations
at each level to which the individual is able to respond.
Area is the summation of all the ranges at each level of
intelligence processed by an individual.

d) Speed : This is the rapidity with which an individual
can respond to items. Speed and attitude are positively
related. Speed is much closely bound up with attitude
than are the other attributes. We should not, therefore
emphasize speed too much in our intelligence tests.

Every intelligence test consists these four attributes.
When we test a person, wé give him certain number of
tasks (area) and these tasks vary in difficulty. (level) and
there are certain number of items at each level of difficulty
(range) and they are responded in. a.given time (speed).
Emphasis on these four attributes varies from test to
test. _ a
4:05:4 Thurstone's Group-factor Theory

Group factor theory has been advocated by
Thurstone and his associates. According to the group
factor theory, intelligent activity is not an expression of
innumerable highly spécific factors as Thorndike
claimed. Nor is itthe expression primarily of a general
factor as Spearman held. Instead, the analysis and

164 Educational Psychology

interpretations of Thurstone and others, ied them to the
conclusion that certain mental operations have in common
a ‘primary’ factor, which gives them psychological and
functional unity and which differentiates them from other
mental operations. These mental operations, then,
constitute a group. A second group of mental operations,
has its own unifying. primary factor’; a third group has a
third, and so on. Each of these.primary factors is said to
be relatively independent of others. From further analysis,
Thurstone and his colleagues concluded that seven
Primary Mental Abilities (PMA) emerged clearly enough
for identification and used in test design. They are:

_ 1. Space visualisation : The ability to visualise
geomeiric pattern in space.
2... Perceptual speed : Quick and accurate noting
of details.
3. . Numerical ability : Quickness and accuracy
in simple arithmetic operations. a

4. Verbal comprehension : Knowledge of

meaning and relationship of words.

5. Word fluency : Ability to think and us@ many
isolated words at a rapid rate.

6. Rote memory : Immediate recall of materials
learned.

7.. Reasoning : Ability to see relationships in

situations described in symbols.

4:05:4:01 Contributions of Thurstone's

Theory of Intelligence

Imporiant contributions of Thurstone's theory of
intelligence are :

a) More clearly specified and defined test categories
and type of test items to be included, emerged.

b) Several test batteries have been constructed on
the basis of group factor theory.

c) On the basis of the findings of this theory H.E.
Garret has postulated a developmental theoly of
intelligence in which he argues that with increasing
age, abilities differentiate out of general abstract
intelligence into relatively independent factors.

4:05:5 Guilford's Structure of Intellect

Structure of Intellect model is the result of factor
analysis conducted by Guilford and his associates in the
psychology laboratory at the University of South California
in 1966. Guilford suggests that mind is composed-of
atleast three major dimensions-Process of aperaticn,
material or content, and product.

Thus, according to Guilford, there can be only 180
different mental abilities, as a result of 6 processes
operating on any one of the 5 contents to produce any
one of the 6 products (6 X 5 X 6 = 180).

Guilford would not agree to the idea of some fixed
amount of intelligence. Instead he claims that
development of intellectual skill as in any other skill
depends on practice. Unlike others, Guilford is concerned
with the social behaviour of the individual in addition to

academic success. Therefore he devised some tests of
social sensibility. He takes into account inter- -personal
skills. He refers to the dynamic cluster of. skills which
can always be improved.

defining specific learning outcomes. These elements
relating to convergent and divergent thinking have
stimulated considerable interest and investigation "High

produce new forms of responses. High 1.Q. people try to
focus on socially acceptable responses.

4:06 Howard Gardner's Theory of Multiple
Intelligence 5

Prof. Howard Gardner of Harward University of
U.S.A. in his book "Framer of Mind : The Theory of
Multiple Intelligence” (1983) has listed eight types of
intelligence. According to him, intelligence as measured
at present through the use of intelligence tests, is narrowly
conceived. Human intelligence ig really broad based and
of many kinds. Therefore attempting to assess’ such a
wide range of mental abilities"by the use of 3 single
measure Called 1.Q. is akin to caging an elephant in a
glass bottle. Keeping in mind the different kinds of human
mental abilities, he propsed an eightfold intelligence, a
brief description of which is presented as follows -

4:06:1 Gardner's Eight Types of Intelligence

il) Linguistic Intelligence : This represents the verbal
ability of an individual.

ii) Logical - mathematical Intelligence : Logical
reasoning and numerical skilis are included in this
category of intelligence.

The intelligence test which are presently in use to
assess the |.Q. of individuals attempt to measure
the above two-categories of mental abilities only.

iii) Spatial intelligence : This type of intelligence is.

largely displayed by sculptors, engineers,
atchitecis, draughtsmen, experts in drawing and
painting etc.

iv) Kinesthetic Intelligence : This type of intelligence
is displayed by Surgeons, dancers, sportsmen,
Therapists etc.

vy) Musical intelligence : Musicians, muscicologists,

and instrumental players like violinist, guitarist,

' pianoist étc. require this type of intelligence toa
greater degree. .

vi) Interpersonal Intelligence : This type of
intelligence is highly important for those who mingle
and deal with the public like Politicians, Salesmen,
Public Relations officers, Receiptionists, Business
Executives etc. requiring the skill to persuade and
win over peopie.

intelligence and Creativity 174

vil) Intra-personal Intelligence : This type of mental
abilities are exhibited by planners and
strategists.

viii) Naturalist Intelligence : This category of
intelligence is meant for Poets, Horticulturalisis,
Environmentalists, Planners who undertake
projects of environmental cleanliness and
Ecologists.

According to Gardner, our present school system
gives importance to promote the first two categories of
intelligence (Verbal and Numerical ability, Logital
reasoning) only. It should take equal interest in developing
other types of intelligence too in pupils so that experts in
fine arts like music, dance, drawing and painting etc.
renouned Surgeons, Designers, Therapists, Sportsmen,
Business Executives etc. could emerge in the society.

Unfortunately, our system of education instead of

identifying and fostering such special talents in children,
lables therm as those with ‘learning disability’ and dumps
them to discard. Those who have exceptional skills in
other fields, do not get due care and recognition in our
educational institutions for the simple reason that they
lag behind others in theirverbal and numerical abilities.
Gardner's Theory, of Multiple Intelligence insists on
bringing revolutionary changes in the instructional system.

_ Classroom instructional activities should become manifold

and multimodal. They should include multimedia learning,
graphical representations, field trips, self-reflections,
team projects, dramatisation, music etc. Then only each.

student in the class can learn using those categories of
activities appropriate to the type of intelligence dominant
in him / her. Learning becomes optimal and joyful only if
learner's potentials are exploited in the process of imparting
instruction. Today Gardner's Theory of Intelligence is
becoming quite popular among the educationalists,
psychologists and philosophers all over the world.

4:07 Measurement of Intelligence
4:07:1 Difficulty in Measuring Intelligence

Measurement of intelligence is not possible in the
same way as we measure the length of a table or the
temperature of boiling water, since intelligence is not a
concrete thing. It is only an idea and abstraction and
therefore its direct measurement is not possible,
Intelligence tesis.do not measure intellectual capacity in

action or behaviour. Itis believed that every human action |

has. some intelligence. behind it. The level of intelligence
an individual has is measured by (|) the difficulty of the
task he can perform; (ij) the range of tasks he can
perform; and. (ill) the speed with which he does.

To quote Samdiford, “the harder the task a person
can perform, the greater is his intelligence. Secondly,
more of tasks that an individual can do, the more
intelligence he has, and thirdly, the quicker the
response of an individual to the given task, the greater
his intelligence is”.

Intelligence and Creativity 173

4:07:2 Some of the Standardised Intelli-
gence Tests :

4:07:2:01 Stranford-Binet Test of Intelli-
gence
Alfred Binet, a French Psychologist, is known as the
father of intelligence testing. To devise test items for
estimating intelligence, Binet started with certain
assumptions regarding certain functional aspects of
intelligence.

a) Intelligence does not refer to one or two narrow
abilities but a complex variety of abilities and so testing
intelligence should involve a variety of tests assessing
higher order mental functions. Tests of perceptual and
muscular skills are useless.

b) Intelligence is best displayed -by general
information.and knowledge and is independent of school
learning. So Binet chose items which a normal child of a
particular age could answer from its. out-of-school

“experience.

¢) The more intelligent individual shows greater
initiative and persistence, is more careful in observing
details and chalking out a‘consistent plan of activity and
he is able to take and maintain’a definite direction in
thinking when faced with a problematic situation.

d) Intelligence increases in amount as age increases.
So Binet introduced simpler items: for younger children
and more difficult and complex items for older children.

The 1905 scale of intelligence of Binet and Simon

============================================================

174 Educational Psychology
lt
contained 30 items and a child's intelligence was roughly
computed by taking into account the number of items
out of the 30, answered correctly by it. Such items as
removing the paper wrapper before putting a candy into
mouth, the difference between paper and cardboard,
sentence completion, etc. were included. The scale of
intelligence was revised and reissued by Binet in 1908.
In this revision, the tests were arranged for different age
ievels, enabling the computation of mental age (M.A.).

4:07:2:02 Concept of Mental Age

The Mental Age is defined as "an expression of
the extent of development achieved by the individual,
stated in terms of the performance that can be
expected atany given age". Mental age generally refers
to mental maturity of a person corresponding to his level

of performance in an intelligence test, irrespective of his
chronological age. If a person of chronological age 8
years is able to score satisfactorily on a test meant for
children.of chronological age 10, then the mental age of
the former is 10.

4:07:3 - Concept of Intelligence Quotient

(1.Q,)

Intelligence Quotient is an index of intelligence. His
a comparative index showing how a particular child
performs when compared with others of the same
chronological age. 1.Q. is computed as a ratio between
Mental age (M.A.} [as obtained from one's performance
on astandardised intelligence test] and chronologicabage
{Computed from his date of birth : however C.A. is taken

Intelligence and Creativity 175
enti
as 16 for persons whose ages are 16 and above as. most
psychologists believe that growth of intelligence stops at
16 after reaching maturity). To avoid fractions we multiply
the result obtained by 100.

ie. 1.Q. aS x 100

1.Q. value 100 refers to normal (average) intelligence;
values above 100 indicate high intelligence and vaiues
below 100 refer low level-of intelligence.

4:07:3:01 Wechsler’s Adult Intelligence
Scale (WAIS) ;

Wechsler's Adult Intelligence ‘Seale (WAIS)
published in 1939 was modified and standardised i in 1955.
Wechsler adopts a general intelligence approach. This
view supported that individuals have different measures
of intelligence and noi of thé same kind of intelligence.

_ Sub-tests measure the different ways the intelligence may

manifest itself.

The test consists of 11 sub-tests - six of the tests
are grouped together to form a verbal scale and five
comprise performance scale.
a) Verbal Scale tests

WAIS is a Point Seale and not an Age Scale like
Stranford Binet test. Here items are not grouped by age
level as in Binet test. But an individual score is based on
the number of items scored correctly. The raw score for
each sub-test is transformed into standard-score witha
mean of 10 and Standard deviation of 3. The WAIS is
supposed to give ‘quite a reliable measure of adult
intelligence. The verbal and performance I.Qs have split-
half reliabilities of more than 0.93 and the total scale |.Qs
have spilit-haif reliability co-efficient of 0.97 for different
age groups.

4:07:4 Classroom Teacher Assessing the

Intelligence of his Students

Teachers with a little amount of training can
administer suitable standardised intelligence tests to
their students and estimate their |.Qs. Following are the
steps to be followed:

a) First of all, a suitable standardised intelligence
test (standardised to our socio-economic
culture backgrounds) should be selected, with
the help of psychologists if needed.

intelligence and Creativity 177
ence
b) The manual of the test should be carefully read
and understood w.r.t. administration, scoring
and interpretation.

c) Next, a suitable testing climate has to be
created in which the pupil would be able to take
the test without fear or nervousness and
perform the best of his intellectual abilities.

d) The pupil should be instructed-to commence
the test items at a level 2 years below his
chronological age. On successful completion,
the pupil should be encouraged to proceed
ahead with the items in the test which are ar-
ranged according to increasing age levels. The
‘Basal Age' should be determined.

Basal Age

Basal age is that age, all the test items meant for
which are solved by the child successfully. Consider a
child of chronological age (actual age as obtained from
his date of birth) 8. He solves all questions meant for
children of chronological age 10. But he solves only 20 —
questions out of 60 questions in a test meant for children
of chronological age 14. The basal age of the child
referred to here with chronological age of 8 is 10. We
can observe that the basal age is 7 in the illustration given
below (in the table)

e) Atone stage the child may not answer correctly
any test item further in the test. At this stage
we stop the test and note down the age, from

the items answered correctly thus for and no
more. Then we proceed to compute the men-
tal age as explained below:

M.A = Basal Age + appropriate age (in months) for
which item meant for the next higher age have been
answered correctly.

9 years and 2 months (110 months), an intelligence test
has been conducted and the obtained data have been as

Verbal Non-Verbal Performance Verbal Non-Verbal
4:08:1 Individual and Group Tests

Individual tests of intelligence can be used to test
only one subject at a time. If many are tobe tested, each
has to be done so separately and individually resulting in
enormous expenditure of time and energy. Such individual
tests may also penalise the bright but shy and nervous

_ children who do not display their best when directly facing

the tester. To get over these obvious limitations of
individual testing, group tests of intelligence were

_ developed.

The first group tests developed were Army Alpha
Test (for those who knew the English language) and Army
Beta Test (for those who are not versed in English ard
consisting of digits and diagrams). These group tests are

_ paper and pencil tests and there is a time limit for
completing the test. It was believed that one who could
_ comprehend correctly and complete quickly-the tasks set
_ by the test items had great intelligence than. one who
- could not so well. Army beta group test does not involve
_ language. Subjects are required to resporid to each item

just by putting a mark next to the appropriate picture or
diagram. Following the army group tests of intelligence,
many standardised group tesis of intelligence like the
Stanford-Binet tests of Terman, Otis group tesis of
intelligence, Kuhiman-Anderson group tests, etc. have
been developed. Group tests of intelligence contain a
variety of items of which the following are sample types

i) vocabulary items

ii) word analogies items

iii} sentence completion items

iv) tests of mathematical reasoning
v) number series

vi) classification

vii) following directions

vill)’ picture arrangement tests

ix) memory for designs

x) absurdities test

xi) common sense tests

xii) digit-symbo! substitution tests
xii} paper and pencil mazes, etc.

Some of these are symbolic and pictorial items and
others are verbal and abstract items. For the younger
age groups test items often make much use of objects,
pictures and concrete items and as age increases words
and abstractions become more stressed.

4:08:1:01 Advantages of Group Tests of
Intelligence

1) As many can be tested at the same time, they
are economical. :

2) They permit shy and socially withdrawn
subjects to display their best in test situations.

3) Administration of group tests is also
comparatively easy. Stencil scoring as well as
mechanical devices help in quick and accurate
scoring of large number of test papers ina very
short time.

~~

They are not of much use in attempting an
indepth study of a single person's intelligence.

2) Paper and pencil group tests often resemble
class or school examinations and children who
have developed negative attitude towards
examinations may transfer such attitudes to
menial tests

3) Group tests have a time limit and hence bring
pressure of time and tension on the testees.

4) Children who have reading difficulties may have
problems in comprehending what is expected
of them in such tests and their scores may be
lower than what they should really be.

Group tests of intelligence are useful when the

intelligence of many persons has to be roughly measured
for some practical purpose in a short period of time
available.

4:08:2 Verbal and Performance Tests

The early tests of intelligence were verbal or linguistic
in nature, So to take such tests, knowledge of language
of the test is necessary. The verbal tests of intelligence
have certain disadvantages. Some may give wrong
responses not because they lack sufficient intelligence
but because of misunder-standing of the language items
in such tests. Similarly those whose mental abilities are
not higher but who have language proficiency may score
high in verbal tests. Aiso linguistic tests of intelligence
cannot be applied to test the abilities of those who do not
know the language, very young children, tribal or
aboriginals and those with sensory handicaps. To get over
these limitations performance tests of intelligence were
devised. (Performance tests are non-verbal; but all non-
verbal tests need not be performance tests). Non-verbal
tests such as matrices, mazes, etc. do not use words but
use symbols and diagrams and other perceptual designs;
whereas performance tests of intelligence make use of
concrete objects with which the subject has to do
something. Performance tesis of intelligence assess the
behaviour arising out of intelligence and involve doing
certain standardised tasks using ordinary materials like
cubes, beads, etc: with which one is familiar. Tests
devised by Pinter and Patterson, Collins and Draver,
and Bhatia (for Indian children) are some popular

Intelligence and Creativity 183

performance tests of intelligence. Bhatia’s tests of
intelligence includes: (i) Koh's Block Design test (ii)
Alexander's Pass Along test (ili) Pattern-Drawing test
(iv) Immediate Memory test for digits and (v) Picture
construction test. In estimating the mental level of
performance, the time taken to complete the assigned
task as well as the errors committed in the course of
performance are taken into account and the M.A. arrived
at from the table of norms provided with the test battery.

4:08:2:01 When to Use Performance Tesis?

As ihe results obtained fron verbal and performance
tests correlate only to a moderate extent, performance
tests can not be used as good substitutes for verbal tests

of intelligence. However they can be used for those who

have sufficient linguistic ablity, along with verbal
intelligence tests so as to get a complete understanding
about their intelligence.

Generally performance tests of intelligence are
preferred in those situations where verbal tests could not
be employed effectively i.e. for those who have either no
or poor linguistic ability, very young children, tribal or
aboriginals and those with sensory handicaps.

4:08:2:02 Limitations of Performance Tesis
1) Administering and interpreting. performance

tests of intelligence requires specially trained
personnel.

2) There appears to be little positive. correlation
between one's score in verbal and in

2)

performance tests of intelligence and so
performance tests are not as reliable as verbal
tests nor should they be used as substitutes
for verbal tests. They should be used only when
verbal or perceptual non-linguistic tests cannot
be used.

They cannot predict scholastic achievement.
Performance test materials are costly.

Many factors other than intelligence seem to
help success in performance tests.

Performance tests cannot be used as group
tests.

Many materials used in performance tests of
intelligence appear similar to the sophisticated
toys with which children from higher socio-
economic groups may be familiar and such
children due to familiarity with material may
score high though they may not really have
‘such high mental ability.

Uses of Intelligence Tests

Intelligence tests help in providing educational
and vocational guidance.

They give the most valuable objective
information regarding level and quality of
mental abilities of children.

3) They help in classifying students into

_ homogeneous groups of ability or performance.

wardness. :

They help in predicting future progress.

They are useful in selecting individuals for
different jobs.

They are used in research in Psychology and
Education: ;

They are used in clinics and mental! hospitals
in order to record the effectiveness of the

Limitations of Intelligence Tests

1)

It is really difficult to say that intelligence tests

have cent per cent validity and they measure ;

only native mental capacity.

Socio-cultural differences, lack of interest or
coaching, test unreliability and many other
factors make us careful in not fully accepting
the computed |.Q. as a true indication of pupil's
mental worth.

intelligence tests are also culture-specific and
not completely culture-fair.

Intelligence tests cannot use scales which have
a known zero point and equal intervals.
Therefore a person who does not answer any
item correctly in an intelligence test is not
necessarily totally lacking in intelligence. Simi-
larly a derived score of 140-does not represent


============================================================
--- Page 101 ---
============================================================

186 Educational Psychology

twice the intelligence of a derived score of 70;
it simply represents more intelligence.

5) Measured I.Qs. are affected by testing climate,
familiarity of the individual with test items,
emotional interference, etc.

4:11 Culture-Fair Tests

In should be remembered that most of the
intelligence tests are culture specific and the items often
favour socio-economic groups which the test conductor
is linked. This bias may not be conscious but is there.
Matters taken for granted in one culture can not be taken
for granted in another culture; this applies equally to
deprived sub-cultures within more advanced cultures in
the same society. Further, mental tests emphasize speed
and in non-competitive cultures, speed is not valued as
much as slowness. It is for this reason that what are
known as “culture free” or “culture fair" tests of
intelligence are attempted to be constructed now. Certain
tests devised by Cattell which consists of items of
classification, completion of series, matrices and spatial
perception and the progressive matrices of Ravan (it
consists of figures and designs; the subject apprehends
relationship between figures and selects appropriate part
for completion of each pattern of system of relations)
appear to be culture-free and applicable to children of
different cultures as well as socio-economic levels.

4:12 Meaning of ‘Creativity’

Creativity is the capacity of the individual to discover
or produce new ideas. It may also include restructuring

intelligence and, Creativity 487

or rearranging the old idea. The only precaution for
renaming an expression as creative is that it should not
be a mere repetition or reproduction of what has already
been experienced or learned.

Ausubel defines creativity as “a rare capacity for
developing insights, sensitivities and appreciations
in a circumscribed content area of intellectual or
artistic activities”.

Torrance speaks of creativity as a mental process
of seeing or creating most unforeseen and novel
relationships between two or more things or ideas. Infact
according to Terrance two stages are involved in this
process (i) to shake and throw things together, and to
discriminate from a variety of different possibilities and
(ii) to synthesize and bring together elements in a new
and original ways.

Bruner states that all forms of creativity grow out of
a combinational activity, a placing of thing in new
perspective.

Drevdahl defines creativity as the capacity of a
person to produce compositions, products or ideas which
are essentially new or novel and previously unknown to
the producer. ’ ;

in the words of C.R. Rogers “Creative process is
the emergence in action of a novel relation or product,
growing out of the uniqueness of the individual on

the one hand, and the materials, evenis, people or

circumstances of his life on the other”.

188 Educational Psychology

4:12:1 Nature (Characteristics) of Creativity

1. The end product of creative thinking should be
something tangible such as a poem, a piece of
music, a scientific theory or a new mechanical
or electrical contrivance.

2. Everyone possesses creative powers to some
degree.

3, Although creative abilitiés are natural
endowments, yet they are capable of being
nourished or nurtured by training or education.

4. Any creative expression is a source of joy and
satisfaction to the creator. There is perfect
individuality in one’s creative expression.

5. The creator is the person who is able to make
ego involved statements like ‘It is my idea’, ‘I
have solved the problem’, etc. In creative
expression, there is complete ego involvement.

6. Creativity involves divergent thinking, having |

freedom for multiplicity of responses, choices
and lines of action. By travelling on the routine,
beaten track one cannot create but only
reproduce or repeat.

7. The field of creative expression is very wide. It

covers all the aspects of human accomplish-
menis like scientific inventions and discoveries,

composing of poems, writing of stories and —

dramas and good performance in the field of

dance, music, painting, sculpture, political and —

intelligence and Creativity 1a9

social leadership, business, teaching and other
professions.

8. The important components of creativity as
identified by J.P. Guilford and Torrance are :
i) ideational fluency;
ii) originality
iii) flexibility;

iv) divergent thinking;

v) persistence;

vi) self-confidence:

vii) sensitiveness: and

vill) ability to see relationships and make ©
associations.

4:13 Stages in the Process of Creative
Thinking

Graham Wallas and Patrick (independently) have

- indicated four stages of creativity. They are preparation,

incubation, illumination and verification (and revision if
needed).

1.Preparation : In ibe preparation stage, the problem
is defined and explained. it means orientation with the
problem and involves purposeful study, discussion with
others and acquisition of facts. Relevant facts and
materials considered essential are gathered. The plan of
action is formulated. Creative work is largely work of
diligence and industry. Perspiration, rather than
inspiration is proper preparation. No painter, poet,

============================================================

490 Educational Psychology
nO
scientist or novelist has reached great eminence
overnight and almost every creative thinker reports that
he worked laboriously during his early days.

2.Incubation : This stage is characterised by overt
behaviour. During this stage one can make rest or sleep
or do even some other problem. Just as nothing is added
to the egg but only it is kept warm, so during the period
of incubation no new knowledge or experience is added
to the existing stock. During this stage there is no external
disturbance. it is common experience that we sometimes
forget an important name. If recalling is postponed, later
on it comes to our mind. Hurry and compulsion are fatal
to creativity. In incubation, the mind is relaxed. If
incubation is hastened it will result in abortion.

3.1Humination : Incubation leads to illurnination.
During this stage, there is the sudden appearance of the
solution to the problem. In the case of the chimpanzees
in Kohler’s experiment, there was the sudden dawn of

insight, fesulting in the connection of the sticks with the —

fruit. So iltumination implies insight. Illumination may
"occur any time, even during dreams.

4,Verification : Then comes the final stage, that of
verification. During this stage, we determine whether the
solution is the correct one or not; sometimes the
solution needs some modification. This is the
evaluation of the solution of the problem. Then in the

light of the results of verification or testing, revision is.

made till the solution is workable. These stages. should

Intelligence and Creativity : 194

not be considered as rigid and fixed. One may get the
illumination without passing through incubation. In
certain cases, the cycle has to be repeated till. they
get at the solution. Creativity as a natural endowment
needs stimulation and nourishment.

4:14 Differences Between Intelligence and
Creativity.

1. It has been established that convergent
thinking is the basis of intelligence, whereas
divergent thinking forms the basis of creativity.
Divergent thinking is stimulus free and often goes
beyond the data i.e. divergent thinking searches for
many possible responses for a given stimulus.
Convergent thinking on the other hand is stimulus
bound and is limited to the data given. Tradition and
rules of logic deal with convergence in thought, with
conclusion following the premises. But originality is
identified with divergent thinking. In convergent
thinking, an individual has the tendency to find out the
one most appropriate idea or socially approved
response whereas divergent thinking allows as many
responses as possible.«

2. it has been observed that highly creative
persons are usually found to possess intelligence to a
high degree but it is not essential for an intelligent
person to be creative. One may possess high
intelligence without having creative abilities. On the
other hand, an adequate level of intelligence is a

--- Page 104 ---
============================================================

192 Educational Psychology
en inna
necessary condition for being creative. A mentally
retarded cannot be expected to be creative.

3. In intelligence testing, the speed and accuracy of
the cognitive behaviour is emphasized while in creative
tests novelty, flexibility, originality, fluency and elaboration
are given more weightage.

Thus it could be concluded that intelligence and
creativity are related (having low positive correlation) but
not synonymous.

4:15 Identification of the Creative Children

The term ‘creativity’ cannot be used synonymously
with giftedness. Creativity in all its shapes and forms is
the highest expression of giftedness that may or may not
be found in a particular gifted child. Creative children
could be identified by employing any of the two
approaches : ;

j. Making use of tests of creativity;

ii.. Making use of non-testing devices like
observation, interview, rating scale, personality
inventory, check lists, etc.

4:15:71 Use of Tests of Creativity

Today there are many specific tests are available for
assessing creativity, the notable ones being Paul
Torrance’s Minnesota Tests of creative Thinking,
Remote Associative Test, Wallach and Kogan's
Creativity Instruments, Guilford’s Test of creativity and

Baquer Mehdi’s Test of Creative Thinking. They employ

intelligence and Creativity 192
tn ena nmr
generally verbal and non-verbal items. Verbal items are
like the following :

1. Unusual uses of ordinary things like a tin can
or a card board box

2. Possible consequences of an impossible event
{(eg.) if sunlight is a liquid]

3. Producing ideas for improving a toy to increase
the jun for children

Non — Verbal items include
a. Picture construction test
b. Incomplete figures to be completed

' ¢. Using cut-outs repeatedly to produce new
figures

4:15:2 Use of Non-testing Techniques

The following external characteristics are spotied in
creative individuals :

i. Keen observation

ii. Indulge in activities with total devotion —
iii. Keen desire to listen others
iv. Using analogies much in their speech

v. Energetic and enthusiastic, spending a jot of
time in reading, writing, drawing eic.

vi. Not readily accepting what others say

vii. Examining the presented idea from different
angles

xiv. They never cast aside any solution merely

4:16 Fostering Creativity among Children

Creativity is an attribute that leads to solving problem
in-new ways; therefore, the educational objectives, the
methodology of learning and stimulating environment and
the evaluative techniques, ali have to be reconstructed
so that the creative abilities of students may be

developed. The following are the blocks to creative thinking, .

which have to be removed :

a. high standards of achievement for low levels
of work such as routine skills of unimportant
maiterial;

Intelligence and Creativity 195
a=

b. inflexibility of assignments and methods of

work;
c. over-emphasis on school marks; and
d. the authoritarian teacher.
Gallagher makes the following suggestions for the

development of creativity of pupils :

i. organise the curriculum primarily on the basis
of concepts rather than facts;

li. allow more individual assignments under
competent supervision; “*

ili. bring the students in contact with the best talent
and knowledge available from the teaching
staff;

iv. follow the general philosophy that truth is
something to be sought for rather than
revealed;

v. provide inservice teacher education for more
competence in both subject mastery and
method of teaching.

Torrance suggests five steps for fostering creativity
among pupils : Ea

1. Be respectful of unusual questions.
2. Be respectful to imaginative unusual ideas.
3. Show your pupil that their ideas have value.

4. Occasionally pupils do something for practice
without the threat of evaluation.


============================================================

nen mm
5. Evaluate with causes and consequences.
instead of saying, “this is good” and “that is
bad”, point out the consequences that this and
that lead to and children evaluate the goodness
or badness of various results.

; Use of special technique called “Brain Storming”
for facilitating the production of novel ideas was
suggested by Osborn in 1963. Brain storming which
consists of having group members suggest ideas. as
rapidly as possible, prohibiting criticism, encouraging
speaking out and evaluating af a later session, holds
possibilities that have not yet been thoroughly tested.

Bruner as well as Suchman suggest the use of
discovery and inquiry methods in teaching in order to
foster creativity among children.

Wallach and Nathan Kogan believe that the
gamelike, relaxed, untimed and evaluative situation is
necessary for the fullest expression of creativity.

Demos and Gowan held that instructor’s role in
furthering the student's creativity is a protective and

nurturing one and appears to consist of the following steps ~

or phases.

1. Inspiration : Inspire the student to learn to
disagree or emulate.

2. Stimulation : Provide for exciting and new.

experiences in the curriculum

Intelligence and Creativity 197

3. Psychological safety and freedom : Provide
a warm, safe and permissive atmosphere in
which the creative students fee! accepted.

4, Guided discovery : Provide direction to a level
and area where it is most effective for learning
by independent discovery on the part of the
student.

§. Encouragement : Develop child’s ideas
through constructive criticism and refer to
competent authorities, to. book and other
sources. *

Summing up the above, it could be stated that the
following are the techniques of promoting creativity
among the children.

i. Freedom to express without any hesitation or
fear .

il. Encourage originality and flexibility; welcome
unusual ideas however silly they may be

ili. Encourage enquiry spirit in children

iv. Test items in examination should not test pup |s’
memory powgr alone; they should Le
challenging and stimulate pupils’ divergent
thinking [(eg.) Instead of asking the traditional
question “what are the advantages to India
due to the Himalayas?” frame questions like
“if the Himalayas were not there what would
have happened to India?” which develop
lateral thinking in students.]
