3:01 Meaning and Definition of Motivation
Motivation is the process of arousing,
maintaining and controlling interest ina goal directed
pattern of behaviour. Motivation is basic to all behaviour
including learning. It is concerned with the ‘why’ of
behaviour. The success in life and learning depends on

our motivation. It stimulates us and directs our behaviour. -

Good motivation in any activity ensures that we
develop an interest in the activity, feel an urge to do it,

Motivation and Learning | 88

pay attention to it and the resulting performance is quick
and efficient. On the other hand, ff there is poor
motivation, we feel the activity is forced on us against
our desire. We may somehow do it or learn it ina
haphazard way but our attention to the task will be
minimum, mistakes will occur in plenty and performance
will also be poor. The most important reason for the gap
between pupil’s potential and the current level of
achievement lies in the area of motivation. According to
Crow and Crow, “Motivation is considered with the
arousal of the interest in learning and to the extent is
basic to learning”. An understanding of the nature of -
motivation, types of motivation and the innovative ability
to make the best use of motivating influences to foster
pupils’ learning are vital to teachers if they hope to get
each pupil te make maximum use-of his or her talents.

Further it helps the teacher to know pupils’ appetites and

desires i.e. to become sensitive to pupils’ needs.
3:02 Definition of Motives

Motives generally refer to biological, social and
learned factors that initiate, sustain and stop goal
directed behaviour of organisms. Motives may be
physiological or psychotogical and-act from within the
organism. The term ‘Motive’ in its root Latin means ‘to
move’ or ‘to impel’. Thus an organism acting with a motive
exhibits a specific behaviour and strives to reach the goal,
appropriate to the motive.

Tolman speaks of motives as tendencies io strive
for goals. Hebb defines motives as evenis which arouse

an organism to action. A motive creates a state of
disequilibrium or tension within the organism and thus
initiates and sustains a particular type of activity which
would lead to restoration of equilibrium by the
attainment of the goal central to the motive. So
‘disequilibrium’ and ‘tension’ appear to be basic to
motivation.

Motives do not themselves lend to direct observation.
They are inferred from the manifest behaviour or from
the verbal repoits. For example a student's plunging into
intensive study will reveal his motive for achievement.
Motives also enable us to predict behaviour.

3:03 Characteristics of Motives
By analysing the definitions of motivation given by

different psychologists, we can infer the following
characteristics :

i. Motivation is a psychological process (internal)
ii, This internal process jis inifiated by some need or
want : .
ii. ‘It-directs our efforts towards the goal that satisfies

the need; i.e. it helps tis to select the appropriate
behaviour so as to reach the goal.

iv.. It brings energy mobilisation in us

vy. ft helps to sustain the attention in one’s efforts or
task

vi. Restless to achieve the goal stops a after the goal is
reached.

lt creates interest in learners as a farmer in his
farming. It energises man to act and to make constant
efforts in order to satisfy his basic motive. .

3:04 - Kinds of Motives

Motives may be broadly classified as (i) natural or
‘biogenic and (ii) acquired or sociogenic. Biogenic
motives (e.g. hunger, thirst, sex, escape from pain etc.)
are unlearned and they are referred as ‘Primary
Motives’. Sociogenic motives often referred as
Secondary Motives’ are acquired and they are
essentially social in character. Animal behaviour is mainly
based on primary motives. Apart from primary motives,
secondary motives too play « a significant role in human
behaviour.

Secondary motives may be classified into three fold
as {a) Motives related to Psychological needs (b) Motives
related to Social Needs (interaction with. othe!
and (c) Motives related to Competency and S Self (Personal
Motives) : a

3:05 Theories of Motivation

The process of motivation (how motives arise and
control the behaviour) has been explained by different
psychologists. While behaviourists emphasize extrinsic
motivation, cognitive theorists advocate intrinsic
motivation. The follewing are.the important theories of
motivation:

Thus his hierarchy of human needs can be
represented pyramidically.as foliows :

1. instinct Theory of McDougall

2 Morgan's Physiological Theory (Hypodermic Model)
3. Hull's Drive - reduction Theory

4. Murray's Need Theory

5. Maslow's Theory of Hierarchial Needs

Among these theories, Masiow’s theory of hierarchial
needs has been taken up for detailed discussion here.

3:05:71 Maslow’s Theory of Hierarchical Needs

; ic. Pca
Abraham Maslow proposed a comprehensive theory Nag ANE =

of need gratification and growth motivation, including
fundamental physiological needs, intermediate needs and
what-are called.meta needs which a person is able to
aitend to only when his lower order needs are satisfied.
Such meta needs are of creativity and self-actualisation.
According to Maslow :

1. Physiological needs :

These are the lower in the motivational hierarchy,
which include need fortfood, water, oxygen. sleep, sex,
sensory satisfaction and the like: These are vitalfor
‘survival and-hence should -be fulfilled before the next
higher order motives become prominent. Perhaps the
main reason-why disadvantaged and poor children refuse
to be. motivated in the classroom to learn: is that their
basic bodily needs remain unsatisfied. _

EPS

i, Human needs are many and multiple; all are not of
equal importance, i.e. needs can be arranged
hierarchially.


============================================================

============================================================

98 Educational Psychology

lL Safety and Security needs :

They include shelter, clothing and personal safety,
security of the future, routine, regularity etc. Children do
need discipline within their levels of understanding in
order to perceive an orderly and organised world.

lll. Affiliational needs :

It refers to the individual's hunger for - affection. “A
pupil who is not loveable because of his behaviour,
needs to be loved most”. Identity implies belongingness
and often underachievement of certain pupils results from
lack of love and belonging.

IV. Self-Esteem needs :

in all of us there is a desire for strength, mastery,
competency etc. leading to a feeling of independence
and freedom. We want to be high in the eyes of others.
According to Maslow, satisfaction of this self-esteem
need generates feeling of worth, confidence and
adequacy. Lack of satisfaction of this need results in
discouragement, feelings of inferiority and inadequacy.

V. Achievement needs :

They may.be classified as need for knowledge and
the need for understanding. Need for knowledge is
satisfied when there is access to information, knowing
how to do things, meaning of things, events, symbols
etc. Néeds for understanding implies knowledge of
relationships, process, the integration of knowledge into

Motivation and Learning a9
Sn. ci
broad structure etc. Thus achievement needs are related
fo intellectual domination and cognitive competencies.

Vi. Aesthetic needs :

This is concerned with appreciation of order and
beauty. One whose lower order needs. are fully satisfied
or known that he need not bother about them, derives
pleasure in beauty, nature etc. Tagore, Wordsworth etc.
are the best examples for this. ;

VIL Self-Actualisation needs =

Self actualisation means to fulfill one’s individual

nature in ail its aspects. One who is talented in one

specific area feels uneasy, if that talent is not nurtured
and utilised. He wants fo. attain perfection in that area.
The highest level of functioning : occurs when a person is
self-actualised. People can. be. motivated. towards self-
actualisation only when the lower. order needs are

Satisfied. .

3:05:1:01 Educational Implications of
Maslow’ s Theory. .

_ The idea that the deficiency needs of pupils are to
be satisfied to enable them to function at a higher
level of motivation has to be borne in mind when
dealing with economically and culturally
disadvantaged children.

psychological safety and showing interest in every
pupil so that he feels that he belongs to the class
are vital.

iii, An individual tends to raise his goals after success
and lower them after failure; so teachers should
maintain realistic level of aspiration by providing

-graded assignments ensuring to include certain
amount of success for every pupil.

iv. The teacher should enhance the attraction and
minimise the dangers of growth needs.

v. Indiscipline in classrooms and campus unrest could
be traced to the fact that our curriculum is by and
large not related to the demands of the society and

aspirations of the people. The uncertain future
makes the students behave hysterically at times.
Therefore the curriculum should be drastically
-changed-and periodically revised so that it serves
the vocational needs. of pupils.

3: 06 Concept of ‘Level of Aspiration’

Frank defines level of aspiration as “the level of
future performance in a familiar task which an
individual, knowing his level of past performance in
the task, explicitly undertakes to reach”... P.Hoppe
defines it as “the degree of accomplishment
consciously striven after by an individual”. Generally
normal people set their level of aspiration little above their
present level of performance, raise it after success and

Motivation and Learning

108

lower a little after experiencing failure. Abnormal people
and people dominated with excessive fear of failure set
their future goals either unrealistically too high or low.

Personality factors such as N.Ach, self confidence,
maturity, self-esteem etc. seem to influence the choice
of an individual’s aspired goal. Generally the two popular
measures used in aspirational studies are :

a. Goal Discrepancy (G.D) = Present Aspiration —
Previous Attainment ;
_b. Attainment Discrepancy (AD) = Present Attainment —
_ Previous Aspiration

For normal persons G.D. will be slightly positive and
A.D. will be slightly negative.

3:07 Two Types of Motivation

There are two types of Motivation. They are: (i)
Extrinsic Motivation and (ii) Intrinsic Motivation

3:07:17 Extrinsic Motives

in another classification of motives, they are divided
into Intrinsic’ and ‘Extrinsic’ motives. Psychologically
all motivation is intrinsic. By extrinsic motivation we refer
to certain incentives or reinforcements. inat are external.
The extrinsic incentives may consist of money or.a toy or
sweet. When a child is assigned a task and told that he
would get Rs. 10/- on completing it within a specified time,
the child putsforth his best efforts to finish the task in
- time. This is a case of extrinsic motivation.



============================================================
--- Page 60 ---
============================================================

104 Educational Psychology

3:07:2
Intrinsic motivation is inherent in the activity itself. In
extrinsic motivation the task is undertaken because it is
rewarding. The task leads to goal. But in intrinsic
motivation, itis not a means to an end. It is an end in
itself. The task is not undertaken for something else but
preforming it jiself is satisfying. Children find intrinsic
motivation in play. Adults are intrinsically motivated to
hear music, go to temples and offer prayer etc. If we play
for a trophy or prize money, then it is external motivation;
but if we play for the sake of the satisfaction we derive
from it, then it is a case of intrinsic motivation.
3:07:3 Merits and Limitations of Extrinsic
and Intrinsic Motives

Intrinsic Motives

Reward and punishment, success or failure, use of
audio-visual aids, cooperation and competition are all
cases of extrinsic motivation. But when we emphasize
rewards and punishment (or.success and failure) too

much it may lead to a negative attitude towards the school
; by the student. This is the limitation of extrinsic motivation.
But when students develop a positive attitude, then it
develops an involvement of ego towards the task. They
become intrinsically attached to the task. This Is
permanent and this is a case of intrinsic motivation.

stages of teaching. Following are certain common
techniques used by teachers to motivate the students :

Rewards in the form of prizes, distinctions, graces,
decorations etc. generate interest and enthusiasm in
pupils and appeal to Ego involvement and Ego-
maximisation.

i. Use of proper incentives as motivating agents,
appropriate to’ the age group of students. [(eg.) In
Primary classes, rewards and prizes may operate
effectively; in high school classes praise and blames
will be more suitable than rewards} my

2. Students should be helped to feel the utility of what
they learn by relating them io practical life situations.

3. Provide feedback to students ‘about their
performance, then and there; announce test results
in the class, possibly the next day itself. This makes
the learner motivated to learn and face the next
test eagerly. Similarly teacher’s nod of head, smile,
verbal appreciation etc. will serve as feedback in
the actual classroom teaching-learning situation,
when students present their responses.

4. Goal setting : Motivational behaviour is always goal
~ oriented. When the goal is clear and attainable,
the students strive hard to reach the goal.

5. Ensuring success to all, at least to some extent :
Graded assignments should be given such that
every one will have some success initially and
continue their efforts but the talented may claim
more success or full success. ;

6. Competition and Co-operation : Teachers should

stress cooperation as a motive in study and sporis.
Where competitions are used, it should be set

among the groups with frequent changing of group
members. Within each group, individual members -

should be goaded for self-competition.

Professional competency and sensitivity to the
needs of pupils help the teacher in his task and
kindle students’ interest in their learning. The
imaginative use of Audio-visual Instructional Aids
ig of great value in making the classroom teaching
interesting.

8. Avoid excessive motivation as it is self-defeating.

Develop positive attitude in pupils towards the
school. situation and towards learning itself and
proper teacher-pupil relationship is basic to such
an attitude.

Besides the strategies discussed above, some

modern dynamic methods of instruction like team
teaching, group discussion, brain storming, quiz
programmes, etc. will keep the tempo of the class. Any
teacher can become a motivating teacher if he adheres
to the following : ;

a.
b.
Cc.

Well structured teac hing.
increased participation of the learners.

Warmth and enthusiasm of the teacher in
appreciation of students’ efforts.

Setting clear-cut goals, within the reach of the
pupils.

&.

Good rapport with the students inside and outside
the class

Like a stage actor, the teacher should. keep the
tempo in the class by resorting to proper modulation
of voice, gestures, etc. using varied techniques like
demonstration, illustration (visual and verbal), etc.

Continuous internal assessment provides for
continued motivation, eliminating needless tension
in the last minute.

3:09 Meaning and Definition of ‘Learning’

The knowledge we acquire, the language we speak,

_ the habits, attitudes and skills developed in us are all
due to learning

Psychologists define learning as “a relatively

permanent change in behaviour, which occurs as a
result of activity, training, practice or experience” This

detinition of learning has three important elements:

2)

1) Learning results in change in behaviour.

it isa change that takes place through practice or
experience. (Changes due to growth and: maturation
are relatively indegendent of activity, practice or
experience and hence they are not learning).

Before it can be called learning, the change must
be relatively permanent. It must last a fairly long
time. But behaviour changes brought about by
fatigue, drugs, illness, warm up, etc. are transitory
in nature and hence they are not included under
learning.

nnn

Thus learning could be defined more simply as

“profiting from experience”.
3:10 Nature of Learning

The following are the important characteristics of

learning:

1.
2.

Learning is universal. All living beings learn.

Learning is continuous; itis a perpetual activity that
takes place from ‘womb to tomb’.

3. Learning results in improved performance.

4, Learning is purposive :Achild’s learning in and out

of school is closely linked up with its goals, purposes:
and satisfactions. Nobody learns anything without
a purpose.

Learning is multiple and integrative. For purposes
of research, psychologists often try to distinguish
different kinds of learning such as verbal learning,
perceptual learning, motor learning, conceptual
learning, problem-solving and emotional learning;
but these distinctions, though useful, are artificial.
For example, a girl who learns shorthand does not
learn a motor skill only. She also learns many
arbitrary relationships between short visual symbols
and how to make and apply the symbols (verbal,
motor and associative learning). At the same time,

_ she certainly learns some attitudes about shorthand,

the commercial world and. herself (emotional
learning).

. Learning is contingent upon experience.

Motivation and Learning

Hence ‘Learning’ is not something to be given; itis

to be gained by self-experience. A person's knowledge
or learning is the result of that person's experience.

31 Factors Influencing Learning

The following factors have been found to exert

influence in one's learning:
4:

Motivation : McConnell states that a driving force
is necessary for an individual to learn. Psychologists
like Gates point out that motives are largely
responsible for one’s normal behaviour as weil as
changes noticed in them. Thus we may concludethat
motivation is a major factor in one's learning.

Needs : Environmental needs stimulate an individual
to learn. As needs multiply, amount of learning also
increases.

Maturation is important for one to learn. Maturation

provides the necessary learning readiness in
individuals.

Feedback received while learning helps to accelarate

and consolidate one's learning.

The level of intelligence of a person, determines
his learning method, rate of learning, nature and
amount of the material learnt. :

Attention is a pre-requisite for learning. A warm,
pleasant atmosphere is highly helpful in learning.
Getting success initially as one starts learning induces
further learning.

theories of learning arose out of the Gestalt point of view
according to which human experiences have certain
“field properties” that make a ‘total’ or ‘whoie’
phenomenon greater than the sum of its individual parts.
Field is the total psychological world in which an individual
operates at a given moment. An individual reacts not io
the environment as it is but as he perceives it at the
moment of behaviour. What is important in learning is
not the awareness of isolated elements but the meaning,
the situation has for the individual. Relation among
elements is more important than the elements
thernselves. Learning “involves structuring the
cognitive field and formulating cognitive patterns
corresponding to the relation among stimuli in the
environment”. Due to learning, our experiences are
reorganised so as to make them systematic and
meaningful patterns. Learning is not building simple
perceptions inte complex patterns, but one of proceeding
from ‘a complex unit that is partially understood to a
gradual clarification’. Field theories emphasize
organisation, relationship, meaningfulness, insight
and cognitive clarity.

The major differences between Association and Field
theories are listed as follows:

3:13 Thorndike’s Connectionism

Thorndike’s Connectionism also referred to as
‘trial and error learning’ is based on experiments
conducted by him. Thorndike spoke of learning as a trial
and error process developing neural connections betweon
stimuli and responses. When a stimulus is presented,
the organism picks a response and connects ‘it; by
repeated trials the organism eliminates the errors
gradually and selects the appropriate response for the
stimulus and connects it. Learning-is a matter of
accidental hitting of correct response which is ‘stamped
in’ as a result of satisfaction. A irial is defined by the
length of time (or of number of errors committed) in a

single reaching of the goal.



============================================================
--- Page 66 ---
============================================================

116 Educational Psychology
A

Animals mostly use trial and error learning. Human
beings too resort to it to learn complex and abstract tasks
as weil as tasks involving motor skills. According to
Thorndike, the law of effect is the basic principle of
learning.

3:13:1 Characteristics of Trial and Error
Learning

There are four characteristic features of trial and
error learning.

i. There is some sort of motive that arouses and
sustains the activity. This motive appears in the
form of a need, a problem or goal. This impels one
to activity
The organism makes several different kinds of
responses to the situation Le. varied responses.

iii. There is a progressive elimination of the irrelevant,
unsuccessful forms of activity:

iv. Finally, there is progressive integration and
establishment of the response by which the goal is
achieved.

3:13:2 Thorndike’s Puzzle Box Experiment

He placed a hungry cat in the puzzle box. A piece of /

fish in a dish was kept outside the box. The box could be
opened by correctly manipulating a latch. On seeing th
fish, the cat became restless and made frantic effort
such as biting, clawing, and dashing the wails before th

latch moved accidently and the door opened. On-

subsequent trials such incorrect responses i.e. biting

Motivation and Learning T17

clawing and dashing are gradually stamped out and the
cat took less time on them. After a few triais the cat was
found to have eliminated all the wasteful movements
(errors) and it operated the mechanism (latch) with
considerable ease in the first attempt itself. This
experiment shows that learning is simply selecting and
connecting the correct response with the given stimulus
by a process of progressive reduction of incorrect
responses and stamping in the correct response through
trial-and-error. If the trials were continued even after
iearning to do the task correctly, efficiency of performance
of the cat increased (time taken to finish the task correctly,
decreased) and reached the maximum level, after which

3:13:3 Thorndike’s Laws of Learning

Based on the findings obtained in his puzzle box
experiment, Thorndike enunciated three primary laws of
learning viz. Law of readiness, law of exercise and law
of effect.

1. Law of readiness : “When any conducting unit
is ready to conduct, to allow it to. do so is
satisfying, not to allow it to do so is annoying.
When any conducting unit is not ready to
conduct, for it*to conduct is annoying”.
Thorndike’s law of readiness is a law of preparatory
adjustment and not a jaw about growth.

Educational implications : a) The teacher shouid
see that the child is motivated to learn before he
begins to teach. Motivation is the royal road to

learning. Preparatory exercises that will hasten the
state of readiness can be given. The teacher should
introduce a lesson by relating it to the background
experience of the child.

Interest inventories and aptitude tests can also be
administered to know the entry behaviour of the
learners, especially in admitting students for
specialised courses.

Law of exercise “When a modifiable
connection is made between a stimulus and
response, other things being equal, that
connection’s strength increases if it is repeated
a number of times”. This is called the Saw of
frequency’. This is akin to what we mean when we
say practice makes perfect.

Another principle governing trial and error is that an

act which has just recently been performed has an

’ advantage of being repeated once again, for the simple
reason that it is fresh in the experience of the organism.
This principle is called ‘law of recency’.

These two laws of frequency and of recency are

grouped together under the name of law of exercise.

Educational implications : a) After learning
anything, adequate practice or drill should be
undertaken to ensure that learning becomes stable
and effective.

b) Periodical review of learned material is
necessary.

c) Mere drill or exercise is not enough; continuous
feedback is also necessary. ;

d) Bad habits can be eliminated through disuse,
leading to atrophy or forgetting.

Law of effect : ‘it refers to the strengthening or
weakening of a connection as a result of its
consequences. The law states, “when a modifiable
connection is made between a stimulus and a
response and is followed up by satisfying state
of affairs, its strength increases; when followed
by dissatisfying state of affairs, its strength
decreases”. ;

As “success leads to further success”, school
activities can be arranged in such a way that all
learners may have some degree of success and
confidence in their work i.e. ail assignments should
be so graded that everyone geis some success
initially.

Learning

The following are the important limitations of

Thorndike’s theory of learning:

motor learning and that too for learning a complex

ence
task in an unfamiliar situation. All human learning
does not take place at the physical level alone.

2. Thorndikian theory reduces intelligence to the
capacity to form S-R bonds, i.e. learning becomes
mechanical and the cognitive skills like thinking,
reasoning, comprehending, imagining, etc. have no
relevance in learning. This may be true in animal
learning. Human beings are unique for their
intelligence and the use of their sharpened cognitive
capacities.

3. According to Thorndike, what fixes the correct
patiern of activity is recency, frequency and effect
of the elements that through association go to make
up the pattern of activity. But this is not true in the
case of complex high order learning. A complex
algebraic problem cannot be solved by repeatedly
doing the problem, without proper understanding.

3:14 Classical Conditioning

in 1904, Russian physiologist lan Pavlov, during his
experimental work on dog’s digestive process,
accidentally noticed the secretion of saliva in the dog on
the sight of food or hearing the footsteps of the caretaker.
Conditioning can be defined as “a process in which a
neutral stimulus which is not associated with any
specific natural response, on pairing with a natural
stimulus, acquires all the characteristics of natural
stimulus”. For example, if food is presented, saliva flows.
Food is the ‘natural stimulus’ (or unconditioned
stimulus-U.C.S.) that can elicit the ‘natural response’
(or unconditioned response-U.C.R.) ‘salivating’. The

Motivation and Learning 121

sound of a bell which is a neutral stimulus, not associated
with any specific response originally, when paired with
food a number of times, acquires the characteristics of
food and starts eliciting the response of salivation, even
when presented alone. Now we say the dog has been
conditioned to the sound of bell and we refer. the bell
sound as ‘conditioned stimulus’ (C.S.) and ‘salivation’
as ‘conditioned response’ (C.R.). The classical
conditioning’ of Paviov is also called ‘stimujus
substitution’ because we substitute a neutral stimulus,
through the process of ‘contiguity’ (occurrence of two
events in quick succession). ™

3:14:1 Paviov's Experiment

When we put food in the mouth of the dog, the dog
salivates. This response,.on the part of the dog, is natural
and unfailing. Food is called as the unconditioned
stimulus (UCS) and the salivation by the dog is called
unconditioned response (UCR). Food is called UCS and
salivation is called UCR because the response depends
upon no special condition and it is unlearned and implies
no pre-conditions. During his experimentation on dogs,
he presented food, a few seconds after ringing a bell. At
first the dog did not exhibit any specific response on
hearing the ringing bell. Sometimes it may turn round
towards the direction of sound, raise its ears, or indulge
in barking etc. but not salivate. But when it started taking
food, it salivated. This showed that the bell sound is a
neutral stimulus, as it is not capable of eliciting any
specific response. This is the first stage of the experiment.


============================================================
--- Page 69 ---
============================================================

122 Educational Psychology
nett

When the experiment of pairing the bell sound
(neuiral stimulus) with the presentation of food (natural
stimulus) for about 15 days continuously, it was noticed
that the dog started salivating even on hearing the bell
sound, well ahead of seeing the food. Now the bell sound
has acquired the capability of eliciting a specific response
(salivating) for it. Now it is said the dog has been
conditioned to the ‘ringing bell’. This phenomenon of
making a neutral stimulus to elicit a specific response,
by continuously pairing it with a natural stimulus is termed
as ‘conditioning’. ;

Symbolic representation of classical conditioning is
given below :

Motivation and Learning ; 123

by UCS (food), for few days, it means there is no
reinforcement. A stage comes when the dog stops to
secrete saliva. This process is known as extinction.

The classic example for conditioning is
Thenaliraman's cat, which on burning its mouth by lipsing
hot milk, started running away from white liquids after
that incident. It is also quite common to notice that people
bring down wild pigeons usually sitting on high towers by
employing domesticated and trained pigeons.

Conditioning appears to be. the simplest type of
learning and the basis for further and more complex lypes
of learning. Most of the animal learnings could be
explained through the concept of conditioning.
Conditioning appears to be an imporiant means of
learning among human beings too, particularly in
childhood. Simple patterns of behaviour, learning of words
and their associated meanings, new emotional responses
may all be satisfactorily explained using the concept of
conditioning.

3:14:2 Educational implications of
Conditioning Theory of Learning
1. Classical conditioning is used in language learning
by associating worgls with pictures or meanings.
2. It can be used to develop favourable attitude
towards learning, teachers, subjects and the school.
3. Developing good habits in children such as

cleanliness, respect for elders, punctuality, etc.

3:14:3 Limitations of Conditioning Theory of
Learning

Complex areas of learning, involving generalisation,
abstraction, reasoning, understanding and problem-
solving cannot be explained by conditioning process. It can
describe only those learnings related to emotional shaping
and habit formation. ;

3:14:4 Laws of Conditioning

From his experiments of conditioning, Pavlov derived
the following five laws :

i. Law of Causation : According to this law, a

conditioned response is established by a series of
contiguous pairings of CS and UCS. That is, when the
UCS. and CS are presented in temporal contiguity
(associated in time), a conditioned response gets
established.

(Simultaneous
conditioning)

Zi

conditioning)

(Trace —— (Backward
conditioning) conditioning)
(Temporal relationships in conditioning}

Motivation and Learning 425

Best conditioning occurs when the CS and UCS are
presented simultaneously or CS is the signal heralding
the occurance of UCS.

2. Law of Experimental Extinction : if ihe CR is
elicited without reinforcement by the presentation of the
UCS, then the CR gets weakened and finally disappears.
Suppose the salivation is conditioned by ringing the bell,
without presenting the reinforcing agent viz., food (UCS),
after a few trials, the response (the amount of saliva)
graduaily reduces and finally the response may noj occur
at all. The dog probably thinks that it cannot be fooled
any further. However this disappearance of the CR is not
permanent. When the dog is again brought from rest it
once again salivates on hearing the bell. This immediate
recovery of conditioned response is called ‘Spontaneous
recovery’.

3. Law of Generalisation : Once the C.R. is
established, it may be elicited by any stimulus similar to
the original CS. lf conditioning was established using bell
as the CS, the C.R. will occur even for a buzzer. If fear
response is obtained for a policeman, it may be obtained
for anybody in kaki uniform.

4. Law of Discrimination (or selective
conditioning) : A selective CR can be established by
selective reinforcement. Suppose a CR is established to
a bell sound the same generalisation is shown to a buzzer
sound also. If the CR that follows the bell sound is
reinforced by presenting the UCS, and the CR that follows


============================================================
--- Page 71 ---
============================================================

125 Educational Psychology

the buzzer sound is not reinforced, then the CR to the
buzzer sound gets weakened and becomes inactive.

5. Law of Higher order Conditioning : The pairing
of a neutral stimulus with a UCS results not only in its
becoming a conditioned stimulus for the response but
also in its becoming a reinforcing stimulus in its own right.
Thus what was formally a CS (say bell sound) can be
used in a second pairing phase to conditioning another
neutral stimulus (say light). Pavlov called this
phenomenon second order or higher order conditioning.
Second order conditioning is weak as compared io first
order or primary conditioning.

3:15 Concept of ‘Reinforcement’

Any stimulus is’ a reinforcer if it increases the
probability of occurance of a particular desired response.
For example, in Paviov’s experiment, food was presented
immediately after the dog heard the bell sound and started
salivating. Here to increase the occurance of the
conditioned response viz. salivating on hearing the bell
sound, food was presented as a reinforcer.

Thus ‘reinforcement’ could be defined as the
phenomenon in which a desired response when
emitted is strengthened by presenting a reinforcer
and thereby increasing the frequency of occurance
of that particular response.

3:16 Positive and Negative Reinforcers

A positive reinforcer is any stimulus, which when
applied following an operate response, strengthens the

Motivation and Learning 127

probability of occurance of that response (eg. Food, water
or any other reward). Due to our social learning, prize,
praise, money, social recognition etc. also serve as
positive reinforcers.

A negative reinforcer is any stimulus which, when

_ removed following an operant response, strengthens

the probability of occurrence of that response (eg.
Loud noise, bright light, extreme heat or cold, electric
shock, etc. ). Reward-training procedures use positive
reinforcers. Escape or avoidance training uses negative
reinforcers.

Punishment is not a negative reinforcer as it
involves the presentation of an aversive stimulus to
decrease the probability of occurance of a response. But
the termination or withdrawal of such painful stimuli
constitutes negative reinicrcement which increase the
probability of occurance of a desired response. Though
negative reinforcers and punishment are made of
aversive stimuli, they difter in their purpose and method
of operation as depicted in the following page.

3:17 Skinner's Operant Conditioning

8.F. Skinner believed that no stimulus is capable of
eliciting a unique response from an organism. It is the
organism which emits ail kinds of responses
spontaneously. For example, a cat without any reason
licks its face with its tongue, a dog barks, a pigeon pecks
ai dots. All such responses are emitted responses.


============================================================
--- Page 72 ---
============================================================

128 Educational Psychology
nnn a
Whenever an organism emits a desired response, it could
be made to occur frequently by suitably rewarding it by
presenting 2 reinforcing stimulus. Thus reinforcement
of desired response is the essence of operant
conditioning whereas in classical conditioning, stimulus
substitution takes place by pairing the neutral stimulus
with a natural stimulus or UCS. Operant conditioning is
called type-R conditioning in contrast to classical
conditioning in which there is type-S (stimulus)
conditioning. An important point in operant conditioning is
that the reinforcer must come after the desired response
has been made and not before it.

Here to get the reward or praise, the organism has
to operate in (or to deal with) its environment ina
particular way. So this type of learning is also termed as
“operant conditioning”. As the organism expresses &
response or behaviour pattern and through that tries to
fetch the reward, this type of learning is also known as
“Instrumental conditioning”.

3:17:1 Skinner’s Experiments

Skinner’s box is a cage in which a white hungry rat
is placed. A simple response of pressing a lever was
chosen as a unit of desired behaviour. The movements
of the rat were electrically recorded and cumulative record
of the behaviour of the rat was obtained. The rat by
chance pushed the bar and got a pullet of food. After
eating that pullet of food, it repeatedly pressed the bar

Motivation and Learning 129

and every time got food pullets. Food reinforced the bar-
pressing response and soon the rat became conditioned
to that response. Reinforcement is central to operant
conditioning. In another experiment conducted on pigeon, .
the pigeon moves about the cage. It was trained to peck
a disk. Every time when it pecked, food was supplied.
Thus food reinforced the behaviour of pecking the disk,
called an operant. The law of operant conditioning states
that if the occurance of an operant is followed by the
presentation of a reinforcing stimulus, the strength of
operant is increased. If the response (operant) is not
reinforced, it results in the extinction of the response.
Extinction of a response means its becoming less and
less frequent. ;

3:17:2 Educational Implications of Skinner’s
Theory

Skinner’s operant conditioning theory has found
application in education in the following ways :

1.  individualisation of instruction : Programmed
learning, teaching machines, computer-assisted
instruction, etc. have their basis in Skinner’s
theory of reinforcement of selective response.
2. Behaviour modification techniques :

- Use of instructional objectives;

- Performance contracting;

- Learning for mastery;

- Teacher Effectiveness Training (T.E.T.).

3:19 Differences Between ‘Reinforcement’
and ‘Feedback’

Reinforcement refers to the strengthening the

probability of occurrence of a desired response either by

presenting the organism after the operant response is
exhibited, with a positive reinforcer or withdrawal of a
negative reinforcer. Positive reinforcers may be any
rewards like food, toys, money, etc.

Feedback refers to the knowledge of results of one’s
own actions. It has been demonstrated thai in the case
of grown up adults, knowledge of results of one’s own
action itseif serves as a positive reinforcer and enhance

the level of performance. Thus ‘feedback’ is one of the

means of achieving reinforcement of desired respones.

Though both rewards and feedback serve as means
of reinforcement, the former operates at the physical level
and the latter at the psychological level. Reinforcement
by rewards is highly suitable for children and animals while
feedback proves to be more effective and satisfying as a
reinforcer for matured adults.

3:20 Jean Piaget’ s Theory of Cognitive
Development

Cognitive developm@gnt arises as a result of the
interaction between the individual and the world and
passes through a series of sequential stages. People have
cognitive structures called Schemata for processing
information and these structures undergo significant
transformations during devsiopment, thus. becoming
qualitatively different at different stages. These are
sequential, invariant and universai.

Stages of Cognitive Development

According to Plaget to "know an object one must
act upon it either physically or mentally" and these
activities that people perform on objects are called
‘Schemas’. In the early developmental stages, the
schemas are mostly physical actions on the objects of
the immediate environment; but as the child grows into
adolescence, these physical actions, become mental
operations. Each developmental stage has its particular
schemas (of organising and adapting to the environment)
from sensory motor actions to concrete and later formal
operations. On the basis of the schemas constituting
cognitive structure, Piaget speaks of 4 important stages
of cognitive development:

1) Sensory-Motor Stage (0 to 2 years)

2) Pre-operational Stage (2 to 7 years) _

3) Concrete Operational Stage (7 to 11 years)

4) Formal Operational Stage (11 years and above)

3:20:1 Sensory - Motor Stage

This stage is mainly based on immediate experience _
‘through the ‘senses’ and the major intellectual activity is
the sensory interaction of the environment. The child's .
activities are physical and without language, to label |

experiences. This stage is characterised by :

i) Development of sensory, motor and perceptual :

skills.
ii) Coordination of motor activities.

Motivation and Learning 133

(For example if a smal! colured ball is presented to 4
six month old infant, it tries to hold it by using all its four
limbs (as it does not know that hands and legs can be
moved separately); but an eight month old infant will try
to hold the ball only with hands; a ten month old infant
tries to- hold a small object like a iemon by a single hand
and use both hands for objects of big size).

iii) At first, fora child an object ‘out of sight’ is ‘out of
mind’. But towards the close of the second year it
learns ‘object permanence’ in space and time.

(For example, to a young child of 6 or 7 monthsrif a
toy, which he is trying to reach, is covered by a cloth
thereby hiding it, his attempts to reach it stop immediately.
But a 18 months old child continues to search for it,
thereby indicating that he knows that the object exists
though it is not present to his sense).

iv) development of rudimentary memory;

v) gradual progression from reflex behaviour to
intentional behaviour;

vi) development of curiosity, and trial and error
exploration of immediate surroundings;

vii) able to differentiaté itself from objects and this is
the basis of self-concept.

In short, we can say during sensory motor stage the
child develops practical intelligence like seeing, grasping,
sucking, etc. to deal with objects in the environment and
cannot use symbolic operations.

3:20:2 Pre-operational Stage

The thinking of pre-operational child is characterised
by:

i) ego-centrism : (use of words which have unique
meaning for the child, which limits the child's ability
to understand others’ point of view);

ii) animism : (treating inanimate objects as living
ones; e.g. children bathing, dressing and feeding
their dolls as if they are alive)

iii) realism : (dreams are considered real) (e.g.
children at this stage pretend stuffed toys are real,
have imaginary friends etc.)

iv) Centering : (the child can concentrate on only one
aspect of a thing at a time).

v) Due to centering they can not understand that
objects are conserved even if they change their
positions or their shapes altered.

‘[(e-g.)

The child may accept that the identical jars A and B
contain equal amount of water. However on transferring
the entire amount of water from B to a wide mouthed jar
C without spill or spiash, the child will assert that A
contains more amount of water as compared to C. The
child considers the height of water column alone without

Motivation and Learning 135

taking into account the breadth of the jar. On transferring
water from C to B back, again the child will say A and B
are equal].

vi) cannot understand reversibility (e.g. what is at your
back? The child answers ‘dog’. Who is in front of
the dog? The child says ‘nobody’. Irreversibility and
ego-centricism are related.

vil) Consider their parents as omnipresent and
omnipotent.

viii) inability to play any game, following the rules.
3:20:3 Concrete Operational Stage»

During this stage, the child masters various
conservation concepts and begins to perform logical
manipulations. Classification and seriation (organising
objects into ordered series as increasing size, etc.)
become possible at this stage. Hée-can also form a mental
representation of a series of acts. But this is only at
concrete level. i.e: hé-can represent things menially only
those objects which are perceivable in the real world.
Beyond their self experiences they cannot think.

[(e-g.) If a child of 5 or 6 years is asked how to go to
his aunt's house nearby, he may not be able to explain
the route; but he will be able to lead us fo.his aunt's
house]. _

Other hallmarks of this stage are :

a) transversibility is known; i.e. If A=2B and A=2C, then
they can understand B=C.

b) understand ‘decentering’ (think of more than one
quality at a time);

c) can play any game according to rule;

d) evaluate crime in terms of magnitude and not in
terms of motive. ;

@) think that their point of view alone is possible and
real and do not believe that there could be other
points of view.

f) their thinking is very rigid; do not understand

relativistic ideas. [(e.g.) they believe that morality.

will be the same in ail cultures, at all places, for all
the times].

3:20:4 Stages of Formal Operational Stage

1) During this stage thought becomes increasingly
flexible and abstract. He can carry out systematic
experiments and keep a record of the track of what has
been done, consider hypothetical obiects and events,
understand abstract ideas and principles. Theorising and
critical evaiuation as well as "pitting the pessible
against the real” are evident ai this stage.

the remaining two of the four beakers) are added, the

lt was found that children below 2 years ignored the

to the pre-operational period start combining the liquids
but they do not maintain a systematic track of what they
are doing. Concrete operational children try some
combinations of liquids but they get confused after
sometime and lose interest

2) Children at the formal stage are able to tackle
any problem in a lagical sequence. Like scientists they

— work at it systematically and maintain record and

ultimately find the solution .

3) Formal operational children exhibit the following
characteristics also :

i) Start evaluating acis in terms of underlying motives.
ii) Understand that the rules of any games or social

system are developed by man by mutual agreement
and hence could be changed or modified.

iii) Start believing that there could be many points of
view on any problem, even though he may not be
knowing all.

_ iv) Understand that nothing is absolute; everything is

relative and hence search for the better alternative

3:21 Educational implications of Piaget's
Theory

1) 'True learning’ as discriminated from ‘verbal
learning’ involves the acquisition of new structures
of mental operations that permit the child to
assimilate new experiments. Hence experiential
curriculum is advocated.

2) Emphasis on discovery approach in learning. *

3) Curriculum should provide specific educational
experience based on children’s developmental level.

4) Arrange classroom activities so that they assist and
encourage self-learning.

5) Do not treat children as miniature adults; they think
and learn differently from adulis. ,

6) Co-curricular activities have equal importance as
that of curricular experiences in the cognitive
development of children.

7) Fruitless pushing beyond a child's cognitive stage
as well as neediéss delays should. be avoided.
Sufficient time should be provided to.the child to
internalise the experiences.

8) Moral and intellectual growth go together and only
after the age of 11, can the child evaluate actions
in the light of motives.

3:22 John Deweys Theory of Constructivism

3:22:1 Meaning of Knowledge Construction /
Constructivism

A person on getting new information from the
environment, process it in the light of his already existing
knowledge or cognitive structure (this gets continuously
developed and modified, based on one’s personal
experiences), and makes sense out of it and finally
registers it in the mind as subjective representa-tion. This
process of assimilation and integration of new information
with one’s own already existing knowledge is called
learning or knowledge construction i.e. learning is the
process of learner making the information he receives
meaningful and registering it in his memory. In other
words, learning is nothing but the process of constructing
knowledge. That is, learning is not just copying
information that are received from outside world either
through seeing, hearing or reading and registering them
in memory. (It is not constructing knowledge). On the
other hand, making the information thus received as
meaningful and assimilating them is, ‘constructing
knowledge’ or learning.

Motivation and Learning 141

in this approach, learners. examine the information
received by them in the light of their experiences, makes
them meaningful and register them in the mind as
subjective representations. in learner undertaking this
kind of process, the teacher plays the role of a cogni-
tive guide i.e. to help students to meaningfully interact
with what they learn, the teacher provides suitable
educational and social environment. Teacher helps
students in their learning activities such as under-standing
new information or experiences and selecting the most
suitable ones among them, organizing and integ?ating
them with the knowledge they already have.

The classroom environment most conducive for
knowledge construction, facilitates students to question,
challenge and formulate their own ideas, opinions and
conclusions. Learning activities in constructivist settings
are characterized by active engagement, inquiry,
problem-solving and collaboration with others. The
teacher will not be a dispenser of knowledge but will
actasa guide, facilitator and co-expiorer. The correct
answer and single interpretation are de-emphasized.

3:22:2 Nature of Constructivist Learning

According to the constructivist theory, construction
of knowledge takes place in short term memory. (This is
also known as working memory of the learners). In this
process, the learner uses the new information obtained
from his environment and the knowledge already stored

in his long term memory i.e. to meaningfully interpret the
new information received; he selects the appropriate ones
from the knowledge in store of his memory and compares
with them. Then he organizes the new information and
integrates them with his knowledge pool.

There are three important activities in the process
of learning. They are:

information received; selecting appropriate

knowledge and interpreting. In this step two acts viz.
‘selecting’ and ‘meaningfully interpreting’ take place.

3:29:3 Role and Functions of Teacher in the
Constructivist Classroom

in a constructivist classroom environment where
teacher encourages students’ initiatives and gives
freedom for inquiry, his role and functions will be as
follows:

i) Teacher frequently asks open-ended questions in
the classroom and patiently waits for students to
answer. ; ;

ii) Teacher gives much importance to students’ higher
order thinking and logical reasoning.

iii) Provides ample opportunities to students to interact
among themselves and also with him.

iv) He encourages students to share their experiences
among themselves.

v) He emphasizes inquiry-based learning.

vi) He gives more importance to problem-solving
approach in learning.

vil) He more often makes use of teaching techniques
like ‘group interacting sessions’, ‘cooperative
learning’, ‘collaborative iearning’, ‘group project
work’, ‘solving jigsaw puzzles’ etc. in his classroom
teaching.

~ The following are the four phases in the teacher
planning and implementing, cooperative learning by
students in the classroom.

i) Making decisions before the lesson begins

ii) Setting the learning tasks for the lessons

groups

iv) Evaluating the process and product of group work

The role of the teacher in these four phases is
highlighted as follews:

3:22:3:01 Making Decisions Before the
Lesson Begins

Teacher should decide upon the academic and social
objectives to be realized by students as a result of
learning, before they start cooperative learning of a
particular lesson. Academic objectives refer to the content
knowledge and skills to be acquired with respect to a
lesson. Social! objectives refer to social interaction skills
to be acquired by the students.

$:22:3:02 Setting the Learning Tasks for the
, Lesson :

’ The teacher should explain to the student-groups
about the learning tasks to be completed. Teacher should
make sure whether the students have understood what
he explained. Teacher sould emphasize that apart from
achieving academic objectives of the lesson, students
should develop social skills too.

3:22:3:03 Monitoring and intervening
During the Group Work ;

When students are involved in learning activities in

groups, teacher should go round the class, visit all groups

and assess their learning progress. lf necessary, the
teacher may give suggestions/assistance io those groups
which are found to be lagging behind in the learning
progress and stimulate them to accomplish the assigned
task.
-3:29:3:04 Evaluating the Product and
Process of Group work

Teacher should provide opportunities to every group
to assess the academic achievement of its own group
members as well as that of the other groups. While
evaluating the accomplishment of students, it should be
kept in mind that accomplishment includes achievement
of the objectives of the lesson in full and development of
social skills.
3:23 Humanistic Psychology and its

Basic Premises

During the 1950s, humanistic psychology began as
a reaction to 'psycho-analysis’, and ‘behaviourism’, which
dominated psychology at that time. Psycho-analysis was
focussed on understanding the unconscious motivation

that drive behaviour while pehaviourism studied the
conditioning processes that produce behaviour. Humanist
thinkers felt that both psycho-analysis and behaviourism
were too pessimistic, either focussing on the most tragic
emotions or failing to take into account the role of personal

choice. :

Humanistic psychology was instead focussed on
each individual's potential and siressed the importance

~~ Motivation and Learning 147

of growth and self-actualization. The fundamental belief
of humanistic psychology is that people are innately good
and that mental and social problems result from deviations

_ from this natural tendency. Humanistic psychologists look

at human behaviour not only through the eyes of the

_ observer, but through the eyes of the person exhibiting
- the behaviour. Humanistic psychologists believe that an

individual's behaviour is connected to his inner feelings,
self image, and self-confidence. By enlightening an

ndividual to correctly understand himself and his

nvironment, his behaviour could be corrected. on

Putting it in short, we can say that humanistic

psychologists are not primarily concerned with instinctual

drives, responses to external stimuli, or past experiences.
Rather they consider conscious choices, responses to
nternal needs and current circumstances to be important
n shaping human behaviour.

Abraham Masiow, Carl Rogers, Rollo May, Eric
Fromm, Gordon Allport are the erninent contributors to
he growth of Humanistic Psychology. ,

3:24 Humanistic Psychologists’ View of
‘Learning’

Humanistic psychologists define ‘iearning’ as a
function of the whole person using his potential abilities
ully and further, learning cannot take place without
nvolving cognitive and affective domains.

According to humanistic psychologists, learning is
lostered by structuring well the information: presented,


============================================================
--- Page 82 ---
============================================================

148 Educational Psychology

providing for conscious choices and control of one’s own
actions, linking learning materials with the present needs
of the learner and involving the learner mentally and
emotionally in the learning activities. Now, we shall look
into them in detail.

1. Conscious Choices and Control of Actions:

Humanistic psychologists give great importance to
choice given for the learner to select the subjects of
study and learning activities. From the day to day activities
of the students to planning and setting their future goals
from time to time, students should be encouraged to
function according to their own choices. This makes the
studenis to learn with interest the subjects they selected
and that too with more attention, spending 2 lot of time.

it is necessary forthe teachers to motivate students and
get engaged in the materials they are learning. If the
learning materials are related to the students’ needs and
interests, even without any external motivation, students

will themselves get involved in learning.

2. Felt Needs:

Humanistic education pays more attention to
and cognitive ability.
Students’ overall mental dispositions and feelings can _

students’ felt needs, interests

either foster or hinder their learning. In other words, thei

current circumstances are capable of affecting their.

learning significantly.
3. Development of the Whole Person:

Humanistic educators believe that learning should
improve both knowledge and feelings of students. Unlike.

Motivation and Learning 149

traditional educators, humanistic educators do not

consider cognitive and affective domains as separate.

The humanists stress that this important aspect should

get reflected in the curriculum. They point out that the

lessons and activities in the curriculum should not only

emphasize knowledge development but also give

importance to the emotional development of students. .
The aim of the teaching-learning process should be the

development of whole personality of the learners.

3:25 Carl Roger’s Theory of Fully Functioning
Person

Carl Rogers considers that every individual has the
_ potential to fulfill his life-goals and ambitions. Only those
who use their potential fully and realize their. life-goals
~ are self-actualized persons (Rogers, 1961). Only those
who, acting without any compulsion or pressure viz. acting
on their own volition and personal choice use their
potential fully and progress towards life goal and succeed
in reaching it are known as self-actualized persons. Like
_ us, they also have various experiences and feelings; but
_ they are highly motivated to continuously strive to improve
themselves and move towards their ideal. Such people
who work with dedicatian to achieve their goals are
variously called as ‘ideal persons’, ‘perfect men’ etc.

3:25:11 Characteristics of Fully Functioning
Person

Rogers identified five characieristics of the fully
functioning person. They are:



============================================================
--- Page 83 ---
============================================================

150 Educational Psychology
te

1. Open to experience: They accept both positive
and negative emotions. Negative feelings are not denied,
but worked through (rather than resorting to ego defense
mechanisms) i.e. when they are overwhelmed with
negative feelings, they try to change them into positive
feelings. They accept failure and treat it as a stepping stone
for success by drawing appropriate lesson from the failure
and improve themselves.

2. Existential outlook in fife: They are in touch with
different experiences as they occur in life and avoid
prejudging and preconceptions. They live and appreciate
the present, without having the dissatisfaction of the past
or the worry over the future (i.e. living for the moment).

3. Trust feelings: Feeling, instincts and gut-reactions
are paid attention to and trusted; believing one’s own
decisions are the right ones and trust with confidence
that they are capable of making the right choices.

4. Creativity: Creative thinking and risk taking are
features of the life of a fully functioning person. A person
does not play safe all the time. This involves the ability to
adjust and change and seek new experiences.

5, Fulfilled life: A fully functioning person is happy
and satisfied with life, and is always looking for new
challenges and experiences.

in brief, fully functioning people are well adjusted
and emotionally well balanced, consider life is interes-
ting and curious to know anything and everything. Often
such people are high achievers in society.

3:26 Educational implications of Learning
Theories

From the different learning theories, it is clear that
‘earning’ is of different types and takes place at different
levels. Factors like pupil’s intelligence, his previous
experiences and the content of the subject more
particularly the topic to be learned, determine the method
of learning preferred by the pupil. To choose the most
appropriate method for the class-room teaching-learning
process, that is suitable for intellectual ability of his pupils,
and the nature of the content to be learned, the teacher
should have the knowledge of different learning theories
as well as their relative merits and demerits. No. single
theory of learning could be considered as the best.
Though the kit of a carpenter contains a variety of tools
and that too in different sizes, an efficient carpenter
chooses a particular tool among the many and puts it
into use in a given situation depending upon the nature
of the work to be done, nature of the wood.he has to deal
with, amount of time available to him to finish the work —
and the abilities of his assistant. For example if he has to
make a hole in a piece of wood, the carpenter may use a
chisel or a drill-bit depending upon the size of the hole to
be drilled and the strength of the wood he has to deal
with. Similarly a teacher should also know when to give
emphasis for acquisition of knowledge, when associations
and relationship are to be emphasized, when imitational
learning will be highly effective etc. so that he could create
the appropriate situations that facilitate the particular type
of learning or teaching. Hence knowledge about ‘earning’
