1:01 | Definition of ‘Psychology’

Etymologically, the word “Psychology” derives its
meaning from the two Greek words ‘osyche’ which
means ‘soul’ and ‘logus’ which means ‘science’ or
‘knowledge’. Thus ‘Psychology’ literally means the
science of the soul. This definition of ‘Psychology’ has

ere ee nent RE
been given up long ago. Today Psychology is defined
as the science of behaviour, the way human beings
behave and the reasons for their behaviour. The term
behaviour should be understood in a broad manner,

to refer not only to observable overt bodily activities

(which alone should be the subject matter of
psychological investigations as per behaviourism) but
also covert and inferred behaviour which could be
designated as mental or conscious activity. As such
psychology is now defined as “a science that
systematically studies and attempts to explain
observable behaviour and its relationship to
unseen ‘mental’ processes (experiences) that go
on inside the organism and to external events in
the environment”. The goals of psychology are
description, explanation, prediction and control of
behaviour including subjective experiences.

By observing events systematically, psychologists
can predict in advance, things that are to follow. For
example if a student gets fail marks in most of the monthly
tests in mathematics, it could be predicted that he will
fail in maths in the annual examinations. The reasons for
poor performance in maths (lack of interest in maths,
lack of motivation, inadequate efforts, negative attitude
towards maths etc.) could also be explained. A maths
teacher with sound knowledge of psychology could plan
for necessary behaviour changes in students so as to
prevent them scoring poor marks in maths.

Educational Psychology and 3
Human Growth and Development
1:02 Historical Development of Psychology
and its Emergence as a Separat
Discipline Hw
Till 19th century, psychology was studied only as a
branch of philosophy. When we look at the original

_ meaning of the word psychology this will become clear.

The word psychclogy comes from the two Greek words,

‘psyche’ (soul) and ‘logus' (science); so the root meaning

of the word psychology is that it is a science of soul. This
is the traditional approach to the study of psychology.
Traditional psychologists attempted to study the location
of the soul, its nature and its state after the death of the
individual. When we are not sure about the location of
the soul, atlempting to investigate its nature is akin to
the efforts of a blind man, searching for a black cat and
that too in a place where it is not. So the definition of
psychology as the study of soul was given up.

Then it was defined as a science of mind. Mind
functions in three domains viz. Cognitive (thinking),
Affective (feeling) and Conative (willing). A mental act is
different from a physical act. If a piece of iron is placed
near a magnet, the iron moves towards the magnet. This
is a physical act and no, thinking, feeling or willing is
involved on the part of iron or magnet. But on the contrary,
when we place a dish of milk before a cat, the cat moves
towards the milk and drinks it. This is a mental act
because. the cat driven by hunger motive, knowing
(thinking) the white liquid is milk, which it likes (feeling
part) to drink, it actually moves (willing part) towards the

milk. Thus every human act or behaviour emanates from
an internal motive, as the British psychologist Mcdougall
puts it.

According to William Medougall, who proppounded
the "Hormic School of Psychology’ (Purposivism), every
response of man is due to a purpose or inner motive called
“instinet’. Mcdougall criticised behaviourism. He stated
that response occurs, not always due to the occurance
of a stimulus. lt is not necessary that we feel the desire
to eat when we look at sweets. Desire to eat depends
upon the hunger motive. Different motives result in
different responses. According to Mcdougall, it is the
instinct that motivates human behaviour. He further
believes that an emotion is present in any instinctive
activity. Each instinct associated with some emotions
(created by subjective experience one had from his
environment) otherwise known as ‘sentiments’ become
the centre of all activities. Without them no activity is
possible. Though all of us have similar instincts, they get
modified according to one's environment. Our behaviour
depends upon the modification of the instincts or our
sentiments. In other words, sentiments are the motives
of our behaviour and these sentiments may be analysed
into instincts and emotions. Thus instincts and emotions
are the bases of human behaviour according to Hormic
Psychology.

Titchner, who developed the theory of 'Structura-

lism’ believed that mind is the basis of all human actions.
According to him there are three states of mind - cognitive,

OO

Educational Psychology and g

affective and conative. The mind was regarded as
consciousness and the ultimate elements of it are
sensation, feelings and images. The nature and siructure
of consciousness can be studied through introspection.
To introspect means to look within. Psychology thus
came to be defined as a science of consciousness.

Behaviour psychologists like J.B.Watson of U.S.A
and others questioned the validity of introspection and
said that psychology should be an objective science. They
bitterly criticised introspection as unreliable. They defined
psychology as a science of behaviour. They tried to define
behaviour in terms of stimulus and response, popularly
known as S-R fromula. For every stimulus, there is a
response. The response to stimulus is behaviour. If you
are pricked with a pin, there is a jerk of the body. ‘Pricking' -

- is the stimulus and the ‘jerk’ is the response or behaviour.

Asimple behaviour consists of the basic unit of behaviour
i.e. S-R. Any complex behaviour can be analysed in terms
of S-R Units chained sequentially. For. behaviourists,
environment is the determinant of one's response or
behaviour and heredity has no influence what so ever.
They also deny Medougall's Theory of Instincis.
Bernard, the behaviougst states that we do not allow
our instincts like fear, sex, acquisition, affiliation etc. to
operate as they are; but we modify them in the midst of
our social environment. Behaviourists also deny any role
for mind in determining our behaviour. They argue that
we talk because of the movement of our tongue and not
because of thinking or functioning of the mind.

6 Educational Psychology

As a revolt against behaviourism and structuralism
Gestalt School of Psychology emerged in 1912.
Gestalists advocated that everything should be viewed
as a whole and studied in its totality. The researches of
Werthemer, Kohler and Koffka contributed a lot to the
development of this school. The German word ‘Gestalt’
refers to ‘configuration’, ‘whole’, or ‘totality’. We
generally perceive the whole and not its parts.

The. ‘whole’ is not the addition of the parts but
something more than that. When we purchase a bicycle,
we only perceive it as a whole cycle and not as spokes,
wheel, saddle, chain, mudguard etc. Sometimes we fail
to notice even some missing parts like bell or lock. So
according to Gestalists perception is unified and
learning is nothing but reorganisation of the field of
perception. Their main areas of investigation are
perception and learning. To perceive an object or event,
apart from our sensation of the object or event, our
previous experiences about them are also called into play.
Things are perceived in the canvas of our background
experience.

Gestalists advocate that human behaviour is based
on one’s perception and perception is influenced by our
past experiences stored in our mind. For them behaviour
is physical (as behaviourists believe) as well as mental
or cognitive. A particular stimulus does not elicit the same
response from every one. People express different
responses as per their previous experiences. On seeing
a snake some may flee due to fear but few / others may
be brave enough to catch it.

Then came the Viennese physician Sigmund Frued
(1856-1939) on the scene with a bang proclaiming the
school of psychology called 'Psycho-analysis’. While
structuralism gave emphasis for the conscious. mind,
psycho - analysis emphasized the role of unconscious
mind in the actions of individuals. Since psycho-analysis
goes deep into the subteranean level of the mind, this is
also known as depth psychology. The other schools of
psychology deal only with surface activities. But psycho-
analysis delves deep into the roots and springs of human
behaviour. The unconscious mind is. the seat of repressed
tendencies and desires, not approved by the society. ‘Sex
plays an important role. According to Frued in the drama
of human existence, sex is the villain of the peace. Frued
holds that early childhood experiences determine the
development of personality. He speaks. of human
personality made up of three major systems - Id
(operating at unconscious level), Ego (operating at
conscious and sub-conscious levels) and Super Ego
(operating at conscious level).

Frued's disciples Adler and Carl Jung broke away
from him and founded their own schools of psychology
viz., ‘Individual Psychology’ and ‘Analytical
Psychology’ respectively. Unlike Frued, _dung stresses
past experiences of the individual. He thinks religion has
a lot of therapeutic value. According to Adler, birth order
of an individual in the family has much influence in
determining one's way of life. a

psychology of Carl Regers, Maslow and others have
also significantly contributed to the growth of psychology
and made it attain today the status of positive behavioural
science. As a pure science, psychology is concerned with
systematic study of behaviour and verification through

experimentation. We can bring psychology under the

category of 'Bio-social science’. The components of
behaviour are :

i)

ii

The conscious experiences of which the
organism is aware of, like that of being hungry
or having pain when injured, etc. and

The unconscious process: (eg.) without any

speciffic reason we get irritated with some
people, become friendly with others etc.

To attain this significant status, many had
_ contributed to the growth of psychology, of whom the
following are notable.

1:03 Definition of Educational Psychology
Educational psychology is defined as that branch
of psychology which is concerned with psychological
researches as applied to any or all aspects of
educational processes and practices. It is in relation

to problems liké learning, teaching and training.
Classroom is the laboratory for the educational

psychologists. By applying the principles and laws of ,

psychology in educational situations, educational
psychology tries to solve the different problems faced in
the educative process so as to make it more effective
and efficient (says Kolesnik, the Russian Psychologist).

Psychology is the science of behaviour. Education
is the deliberate process of modifying one’s behaviour
(knowledge, skills and attitude) through a sequence of
systematically planned experiences to acheive the
predetermined goals and objectives (Redden). Therefore
educational! psychology could be considered as the
science of modifying the learner's behaviour so as to
refine his personality and make him an efficient and
responsible citizen.

1:04 Nature of Educational Psychology

Educational psychology has made tremendous

Educational Psychology and LE
Human Growth and Development

advancement and gradually established itself as an

independent study. Most of the educational problems

come under its purview. Child education, diagnostic and
remedial education, education for the gifted and
handicapped, factors affecting learning, principles of
evaluation, etc. bear proof to the claim that educational
psychology is a special field of study. The study of
classroom climate, techniques of behaviour modification,
programmed learning, micro-teaching, software and
hardware approaches, computer assisted instruction are
all the areas developed by the educational psychologists
aimed at improving the interaction between the teacher
and the taught. Advanced techniques of instruction are
through and through psychological by nature. —

1:05 Scope of Educational Psychology

As Blair, Jones and Simpson say, educational
philosophy is primarily concerned with the. question of
what should be done and educational psychology
attempts to answer the question of how it can be done.
Educational psychology for most part is interested in
means rather than ends.

1. Kolesnik mentions the following problems deait
by educational psychologists as forming the scope of
educational psychology :

i) Differences among students
ii) Motivation
iii) Methods of instruction
iv) Evaluation
v) Classroom management



============================================================
--- Page 14 ---
============================================================

42 Educational Psychology

vi) Mental health
vii) Character formation

2, H.C. Lindgren opines that Educational
Psychology revolves around the behaviour of the learner
in educational situations and as such it should limit itself
to the teaching - learning process and the educational
environment. Of course the other elemenis involved in
the educational process are the learning experiences
provided and the teacher who organises them. Thus the
basic elements of the content of Educational Psychology
are:

i) The Learner
ii) The Learning Experiences
iii) The Learning process
iv) The Learning situation or environment
v) The Teacher

(i) The Learner : The first focal area of Educational
Psychology is the learner around whom the whole subject-
matter is knitted. The subject-matter of this area acquaints
us with the need of knowing the learner and deals with
the techniques of knowing him well. The innate abilities
and capacities of the individual, individual differences and
their measurement, the overt, covert, conscious and
unconcious behaviour of the learner, the characteristics
of his growth and development at each stage beginning
from childhood to adulthood, are studied in this section
of Educational Psychology.

(li) The Learning Experiences : Educational
Psychology helps in deciding what learning experiences

Educational Psychology and ; 43
Human Growth and Development

snare nents teenies ner CARN

are desirable, at what stage of growth and development
of the learner so that these experiences could be acquired
with great ease and satisfaction. In this area, Educational
Psychology has the subject matter which deals with the
knowledge and principles of psychology facilitating the
selection of desirable learning experiences for the
learner. ,

(iil) The Learning Process : After knowing the
learner and deciding what learning experiences are to
be provided, the emerging problem is to help the learner
in acquiring these experiences with ease and
convenience. Therefore around this pivot, Educational
Psychology deals with the nature of learning and how it
takes place and it contains the topics such as laws,
principles and theories of learning, motivation, transfer
of learning, remembering and forgetting, perceiving,
concept formation, thinking and reasoning process,
problem-solving etc.

(iv) The Learning Situation : This focal area of
Educational Psychology deais with the environmental
factors and learning situations which .come midway
between the learner and the teacher. Topics like
classroom climate and group dynamics, techniques and

~- aids which facilitate learning, learning situation, evaluation

techniques and practices, guidance and counselling etc.
which help in the smooth functioning of the teaching-
learning process. are studied in this section.

(v) The Teacher : The teacher himself is a very
important element in the teaching-learning process.


============================================================

============================================================

14 Educational Psychology

Therefore the Psychology of being a teacher (his
motivations, conflicts, effectiveness, professional growth,
mental health etc.) also included in the scope of
Educational Psychology so as to inspire him to become
a successful teacher and play his role properly in the
process of education.

3. Garrison et. al. recognise the following as major
divisions of educational psychology :

1) The child and his development : The course of

development, nature of intelligence, language and.

thinking, socialisation and its role, etc.

2) Learning and educative process : Learning and
motivation, the learning of skills, knowledge,
understanding and problem-solving, character
development, etc.

3) Evaluating Pupil-Growth : Methods of pupil-
evaluation, studying the individual child, learning
difficulties at school, evaluating the results of instruction,
etc.

4) Guiding the child : Personality intergration,
adjustment problems of the child, pupil-teacher relations,
etc. :

In short, speaking with E.A. Peal, it might be said
that educational psychology broadly deals with the
nature of learning, the growth of human personality,
the differences between individuals and the study of
the person in relation to society.

1:06 Differences Between General and
Educational Psychology

The basic difference between General Psychology
and Educational Psychology appears to be the matter of
focus. General psychology gives a comprehensive view
of human bahaviour. Educational psychology highlights
the behaviour of the learner. Learner, learning
processes and learning situations are the three focal
areas of educational psychology.

The learner has the most important place in the
classroom. One important factor that the teacher should
know about the learner is that there are individual ©
differences among learners. There are gifted, average
and slow learners in the class. The class is generally not
homogeneous but heterogeneous. The next area js
learning process. An effective learning. process is one
where the instruction is individualised. The student's
perception, thinking, reasoning, intelligence, remembering
-all come under learning process. The third area is the
learning situation, that includes the conditions like
physical factors, the tone of the class, attitude and
behaviour of the teacher, etc. In. short, we call this as
classroom climate. Generaily there is diversity in the
classroom and Educational Psychology aims to prepare
the teacher to realize the individual differences among
his pupils and plan accordingly to maximize the achieve-
ment of each individual learner entrusted-to his care.

1:07 Significance of Educational Psychology _

Educational psychology helps the teacher in the
following ways :

A) Contribution to Theory of Education :

1) To understand the development characteristics
of children : To be a successful doctor, one must have
the required professiona! knowledge and skills as well
as the knowledge about the nature of the patient whom
he wants to treat. in the same way, if one wants fo be a
successful teacher, he must know about the science of
behaviour of learners. Children pass through different
stages of development as infancy, childhood and
adolescence. These developmental stages have their own
characteristics. If the prospective teacher knows these
characteristics he can utilise them in imparting instruction
and moulding their behaviour according to the specified
goal of education.

2) To understand the nature of classroom
learning : To instruct effectively in the class, the teacher
must understand the principles of learning and various
approaches to the learning process, problems of learning
and their remedial measures. It also gives the knowledge
of various approaches to understand the learning
process, factors affecting it, and guidance for effective
learning.

3) To understand individual differences and adjust
his teaching to the needs and the requirements of the
class which has a great range. of individual differences.

Educational Psychology and Wy
Hurnan Growth and Development

4) Te understand effective teaching methods :
Classroom teaching is not dependent on any one theory.
It is related and uses several theories of teaching-
learning. The teacher must be acquainted with knowledge
of various theories in order to organise his class-room
teaching. Educational psychology provides us with the
knowledge of different approaches evolved to tackle the
problems of teaching at different age levels.

5) To understand the causes of the problems of
children which occur at different age levels and
successfully solve them. *

6) Knowledge of mental health : Mental health of
the teacher and the taught is very important for efficient
learning. The teacher from the study of psychology can
know the various factors which are responsible for the
mental ill-health and maladjustment. He can prevent
maladjustment in children provided. he is equipped with
the fundamental knowledge of mental hygiene.

7) Curriculum construction : Psychological
principles are used in formulating curriculum for different .
stages. Needs of the pupils, their developmental
characterisiics, learning pattern and needs of the society,
all these are to be incorporated in the curriculum.

8) Measurment of learning . auicome
Psychological tools help the teacher to assess the
learning outcome of the students. He can also. evaluate
his teaching methods and in the light of the performance
of his students can modity his strategy of teaching.

ee
9) Guidance for the education of exceptional
children.

16) Helps to develop positive attitude.
11) Understanding of group dynamics.
B) Contribution to Practice of Education

1) Problem of discipline : Traditional teachers
believed in the dictum “spare the rod and spoil the child”.
But modern teachers who have the knowledge of
educational psychology realise that the use of corporal
punishment is inhumane. Teachers now tackle the
problem of indiscipline by examining the causal factors
leading to them in a more scientific way. The teacher has
changed his attitude from an autocrat to democrat.

2) Use of A.V. aids : Teaching with the use of aids
that affect multiple senses of the learner is more effective
and lasting. Thus the modern teachers resort to the use
of hardware and software approaches in educational
technology to make their teaching more concrete and

_ stable.

3) School and classroom administration has been
psychologised and made participative rather than
dictatorial in nature.

4) Time table : Now subjects are incorporated in
the time-table taking into consideration their difficulty ievel
and fatigue index. No two difficult subjects are taught in
successive periods. ©

5) Co-curricular activities : Teachers used to give

undue importance to the theoretical subjects in schools.

Activities like debate, drama, scouting and games were

supposed to be a wastage of time. Now we give these

activities due importance for the harmonious development
of the personality of children.

6) Use of innovative methods : Several
innovative ideas resulting from research studies in
psychology have been introduced to improve the
teaching-learning process. Activity-centred teaching,
discussion method, micro-teaching, programmed
instruction, and non-graded school classes at the
primary stage are some of the important innovations.

7) Production of text books : We now write text
books taking into consideration the intellectual
development of children, their needs and their interests
at different age levels.

Undoubtedly the study of educational psychology
may be very heipful to equip our prospective teachers
with necessary skills to deal with classroom teaching-
learning problems. Summing up we can say in the words
of W.B. Kolesnik, that “the purpose of educational
psychology is not to give specific, definitive answers
io questions about methods of teaching or
techniques of dealing with children, not to arm the
teacher in advance with pre-packaged. solutions to
the many practical problems that he is likely to
encounter in the classroom. Its purpose, rather, is to

introduce him to psychological theories and research
findings about learners and the learning process, and
to a method of thinking psychologically, that may heip
him answer his own questions, reach his own
conclusions and solve his own problems.

1:08 Meaning of the term ‘Growth’

In the strict sense of terminology the two terms
growth and development have different meanings. The
term ‘growth’ is used purely in the physical sense. It
generally refers to increase in size, length, height and
weight. Changes in the quantitative aspects, which could
be objectively observed and measured, come into the
domain of growth. Growth is one of the components of
the developmental process. In a sense, development in
its quantitative aspect is termed as growth.

1:08:1 Characteristics of ‘Growth’
1) Growth refers to increase caused by becoming
larger and heavier.
2) itis quantitative, additive, and augmental.
3) Itis objectively observable and measurable.
4) Growth does not continue throughout life, it
stops when maturity has been obtained.

5) Growth may or may not bring development. For
example, a child may grow (in terms of weight)
by becoming fat, but this growth may not bring
any functional improvement (qualitative
change) or development. .

Educational Psychology and 24
Human Growth and Development

6) Rate of growth is not uniform. It proceeds more
rapidly in the early years of life but slows down
in the later years of infancy. Again, at puberty,
there is sudden rise in the speed of growth.

7) There exist wide range of individual differences
among children with respect to growth.

8) The rate of growth of different parts of the body
ig different.

1:08 Meaning of the term ‘Developmen?’

‘Development implies overall changes in shape, form
or structure resulting In improved working or functioning.
it indicates the changes in the quality or character rather
than in quantitative aspects. Development is the result of
growth, maturation and learning.

1:09:1 Characteristics of ‘Development’

1. Development.is progressive: series of
changes occur in an orderly, predictable
pattern as a result of maturation and
experience, Development is ‘directional’ and
‘sequeniial’.

2. Development is continuous in all areas of

mental activity. It does not stop with puberty
as in the case of growth.

3. The goal of development is io enable the
individual to adapt to the environment in which
he lives, Le. develop-ment results in improved

’ functioning of the individual.

Educational Psychology

Development is a complex process of
integrating many structures and functions.

Development is of many aspects (eg. physical,
emotional, intellectual, social and moral) and
individual differences are seen in the different
aspecis of development.

Rate of development is not uniform throughout
the life span of an individual. Actually the child
makes advancement during a particular period
of development and takes rest in the next
following period, to consolidate his development.
In advancing therefore, he turnsback and then
moves forward again like a spiral. Thus it could be
said that development is spiral and not linear.

Development is influenced by maturation and
learning.

Development is very much related to one's
environment. Stimulating environment helps an
individual to develop many skills.
Development is based on modelling the
parents, teachers and other elder members.
Since development is qualitative in nature, it
cannot be measured directly. It could be
assessed through keen observation in
behavioural situations.

Development is possible even without growth.

eg. Even short statured people may exhibit.

strong physical functioning.

development to a very great
extent. :

aspects (among physical, menial,

1:11. Meaning of Maturation

Maturation is a natural process. It is the growth which .

takes piace within the individual. The maturational
changes are the result of unfolding and ripening of
inherited traits and are relatively independent of activity,
practice or experience. Maturation involves changes that
are associated with normal growth.

1:12 Relationship between Growth,
Development and Maturation

Growth refers to increase in size, length, height and
weight of an organism. Growth is quaniitative in nature
and hence can be objectively observed and measured.
Growth is one of the components of the developmental
process. 'Development' implies overall changes in shape,
form or structure, resulting in improved working or
functioning of the organism. Development is progressive;
series of changes occur in an orderly pattern. As growth

in an organism continues, it reaches a maximum limit

and stops after that. This maximum level of growth is
referred to as ‘Maturation’. Development is a continuous
process, lasting throughout the life of the organism; it
takes place both before and after maturation. Growth and
maturation are largely determined by heredity. On the
other hand environmental influences play a significant
role in determining development. ;

In short, growth and development go hand in hand;
but growth stops after maturation whereas development
continués as long as the organism is alive.

Human Growth and Development

1:13 Dimensions of Human Development

We can distinguish certain aspects of human
development such as physical and physiological (bodily)
development, with which are related locomotor ancd-skil!
developments, congnitive (intellectual) development,
emotional development and social development. These
cul across and continually proceed through the various
stages of development such as infancy, childhood,
adolescence and adulthood. Major aspects of human
growth and development are :

i) Physical Development : Anatomical growth and
Physiological growth are the two components of
Physical Development. Thé growth in the skeleton,
changes in the quality and number of bones, changes in
height, weight etc. constitute Anatomical growth. But the
changes occuring in the interna! organs like heart, lungs,
lever, bladder, kidney, intestine, stomach, brain and
groups of muscles are referred by Physiological growth.
Motor Development refers to the grawih and
development of bodily organs like the limbs. and the
related muscles that activate them so thai functional
efficiency (Manipulative skills) is attained. Thus physical
development consists of both physical and moter
development. Even though there are subtle differences
between physical development and motor development,
they are generally referred to as Physical development
as these two develop jointly and cannot be viewed in
isolation. ;

ii) Intellectual or mental development : It includes
the development of intellectual (also known as cognitive)
powers like thinking and reasoning, imagination,
concentration, creativity, sensation, perception, memory,
association, discrimination and generalisation, etc.

iii) Emotional development : Under this aspect,
starting with the basic instinct or emotion of ‘General
Excitement’, differentiation takes place during the
evolution of primary emotions viz. joy, fear, and anger.
Complex and secondary emotions like disguest, jealousy,
elation, affection, anxiety, sympathy, distress, love,
wonder, awe etc. are learned as the child grows and as
oppurtunities occur. The emotional behaviour is
developed to the point of emotional maturity and balance
of emotions wherein the child learns to control emotion
and express the proper emotion at appropriate situations.
Use of language in also resorted to.

iv) Moral or character development : It includes
the evolution of moral sense to discriminate the right and
wrong and development of character. The individual
develops his ethical and.moral codes. Social development
and moral development are intertwined.

Educational Psychology and 27
Human Growth and Gevelopment

v) Social development : Initailly the child is self-
centred and animalistic in character. Gradually he is
developed into a social being, by learning to behave
according to the rules and norms of society in which he
lives. Due to social development he is able to get along
with others in the society and participate in different soical
activities. He strives for social maturity.

vi) Language Development in Children : Language

- development in children appears to be dramatic: It does,

of course, depend upon physical maturation, like controi
of mouth and tongue. Language development passes
through certain stages though it is rather difficult to
distinguish them clearly. The rate and time taken for
language development exhibits individual differences.
There appears to be specific sequence in language
development. Children use basically the same rules of
grammar during the early stages of learning any language
(Brown's study), and so ianguage abilities appear to
mature just as motor abilities do.

The child speaks its first word normally at about one
year, but even prior to this, it indicates its requirements

’ by making various audible sounds and gestures. These

form the pre-lingual stage, and include. cooing and
erying, babbling and gestures like smiling, moving-head
from side to side, etc. As the child learns to speak,
gestures become less and less, but even ijater they are
used to emphasize words.

By about 18 months, the child, on an average, uses
10 to 12 simple words. By the next 3 or 4.months, its


============================================================
--- Page 22 ---
============================================================

28 Educational Psychology

vocabulary increases rapidly and by 3 years, there isa
sizable vocabulary in the mother tongue, which about 12
years increases to 10,000 words or more. Again, by 2 to
3 years, the child uses words to form sentences, uses
pronouns and plural as well as speaking in past tense.
By 4 to 5 years, sentence formation is considerably
improved; simple rules of grammar are observed. After
54, the school, along with the home, plays a vital role in
language development, contributing te increased
vocabulary, growth in sentence length, greater
comprehension in reading, correctness in pronunciation,
and in developing writing skill. Piaget has pointed out
that in children we can notice a shift from ego-centric
to socialized speech as they grow.

1:14 Development Phases

Of all the mammals, man is the most immature at

birth and needs the longest period of development before —

he is capable of the activities and skills of his species.
This prolonged period of immaturity points to the
necessity of education. The human individual is a
developing organism and progressive sequential changes
take place in an orderly pattern frorn conception illl death.

These developmental changes could be best understood

if we study them in different phases of human life,
otherwise known as ‘developmenial stages’.

1:15 Important Phases of Development

Based on certain. common developmental
characteristics psychologists have classified human life-
span into the following developmentai stages .

Educational Psychology and
Human Growth and Development

23

| Prenatal stage Germinal Period (First 2 weeks)
(from conception | Embryonic Stage il to Vill week)
to birth) Foetal Stage (IX week to birth)

During the germinal period, the Zygote grows to Va"
Rudiments of bodily organs are formed during the
embryonic stage and heart beat begins by about 8 weeks.
During the Foetal stage, the child attains gradually its
full size and shape. Cell division and differentiation
characterise pre-natal development.

li Postnatal Stages ; *
1. Infancy From birth to 2 years
2. Childhood Early childhood (From 3 to 6 years)

Later childhood (From 7 to 10 years)

3. Pre-Adolescence (From ii to 13 years)

4, Adolescence (From 14 to 17 years: in the strict
sense, upto the onset of puberty)

5. Adulthood Early Adulthood (From 20 to 40
years) ;

6. Middle-age (From 40 to 60 years)

7, Old-age (From 60 years onwards)

Postnatal development involves increase in size and
diversity and complexity of functions. There are certainly
individual differences and so we should not think that
every child will have each stage according to the age
mentioned.

The above 10 stages putforth by Hurlock, may be
telescoped into 4 wider categories - Infancy (From birth
upto 5 years), Childhood (5 to 12 years), Adolescence
(12 to 18/20) and Maturity or Adulthood (after 18/20), as

teachers may generally have to deal only with these broad _

stages of development in their professional work. It will
also be of value to understand the general characteristics
of individuals particularly during infancy, childhood and
adolescence. These three stages are related to primary,
middle and high school levels in education.

1:16 Physical Development from Infancy to
Adolescence

The bodily growth is physical development. Physical
development along with physiological development

appears to be the basic aspect of human development. -

Physical development is rapid during infancy. A new born
infant is about 50 cms in length and 3.5 kg in weight. It
grows another 25 cms by the first year and weight
becomes doubled during the first six months and trebled
in the next six months.

Proportion of head to body changes from % to 1/8
and the lengths of arms and legs increase as the infant
begins using them more and more.

Brain growth is more rapid. The brain has its full
complement of cells even before birth and achieves 80%
of its adult weight by 4 to 6 years. Another 13% is attained
by the age of 8 with complete development at the end of
adolescence.

The internal organs such as digestive organs, iungs,
etc. grow rapidly and reach a balance of effective
coordinated functioning. Sensory development goes
along with such bodily growth and hearing appears well

_ developed at infancy, though coordinated binocular vision

takes more time. in caring for the iniant’s bodily
development, mother’s milk as also the affectionate
atmosphere in which it is given and later nutritious food,
cleanliness, adequate sleep, optimum sensory stimulation
and bodily activities, are all vital.

The physical development secured during the ‘first
three years is strengthened and made more stable during
early childhood. During later childhood bodily
development appears to slow down a bit; body proportion
approximates that of the adult. The stage of adolescence
is again marked by an accelerated rate of physical growth
along with the onset of sexual maturity. This growth is
often uneven, with different rates resulting in clumsiness,
awkwardness in movements and seif-consciousness.
Girls and boys differ regarding physical growth. Man
reaches a greater average level in height and weight than
woman although at the age of 13 girls surpass boys in
average weight since girls attain puberty about a year or
two earlier than boys do.

Motor activities such as head control, movement of
eyes, sitting, standing, walking, running, climbing {alt
these are referred as locomotor skills) and
manipulative skills like ‘handling of objects with
dexterity’, ‘eye-hand co-ordination’, precision of control,

speed of arm movement, arm steadiness, aiming, etc.
are important for personal and educational growth. The
child makes contact with the external world only through
motor development which is closely related to intellectual,
emotional and social development:

There are individual differences in the growth and
development. An early discovery of the problems and
deviations in physical development can help the teachers
to give proper guidance in promoting adjustments among
children. Proper physical and motor development promote
self-help and competence in children.

1:17 Intellectual Development from Infancy to
Adolescence

Intellectual development is also referred to as
cognitive development. Intellectual development refers
to the gradual growth in what are called cognitive abilities
(ability to attend, to perceive, to discover, to recognise,
ic imagine, to judge, to conceptualise, to remember, to
learn, to reason, to take decisions, to solve problems and
to indulge in meaningful speech) and also to consequent
growth in knowledge and adjustment to environment.
Cognitive development is influenced by nutritional,
emotional and social factors.

The mental powers of the new born infant are
immature and undeveloped; its brain centres are still

maturing and its knowledge at birth is practically nil. But —

even early, observers can notice individual differences in
the mental powers of infants due to hereditary differences.

Educational Psychology and 33
Human Growth and Development

The infant's first intellectual response is to stimuli from
the outside world. Its intellectual activities broaden as its
power of imagery grow and powers of retention of past
sensory experiences and their recall develop. Imagination
which comes to the forefrant by about the age of three,
expresses itself through play activities and it also serves
as a means of intellectual development. Language
{mother tongue) helps in preserving as well as fostering
intellectual growth which continues fo accelerate as
children develop the ability to judge, to reason and to
solve problems, starting from the concrete level and going
iowards the abstract. Creativity heips in divergent
thinking, leading to novel intellectual products and
practices. Psychologists like Jean Plagel point oul that
child’s cognitive processes are not abridged or
simplified versions of adult processes but are
qualitatively different, though certain cormmoén invariants
are also there. Broadly speaking, cognitive development

__ of children can be fosiered by a stimulating home and

school environment with a lot of scope for free self activity
and opportunities for varied senscry experiences.

1:18 Social Development from Infancy to
Adolescence,

Social development takes place gradually. Being a
social person is not innate; it must be learned. The new
born infant exhibits little or no social activity. It is
concerned with its satisfaction of bodily needs. At birth it
ig non-gregarious and the ‘l-feeling’ alone appears to
be dominant. Even about 4 weeks, the infant stares at

Epa

34 Educational Psychology
ee
faces closely and a few weeks later wants to be picked
up. The first significant attachment behaviour of the infant
is recognition of its mother and graduaily this social
interaction circle widens to include other members of the
family and the ‘we-feeling’ emerges.

The early play activities of very young children is
solitary play; later on it becomes parailel play (each child
in a group playing in its own way). Oniy by about the age
of two, the child shows a desire to cooperate with others
in group plays. Thus early childhood is pre-gang stage
of social development but childhood is the gang stage,
‘when playmates have an active role in accelerating social
development. No sex differences is felt at this stage. The
child is assimilating socializing experiences through direct
imitation of the patterns of other children and by
spontaneous reaction to things which they do or to
situations they create. Social behaviours that are
developed during childhood are rivalry, aggression, co-
operation, sympathy, social approval and certain social
prejudices imbibed from adults. Notions of proper and
improper social behaviour gradually develop.

Later childhood (8-12) is marked by maximum social
adjustment in the changeable and variable social world
marking a level of pseudo maturity. Though the child
stays away from its home now a considerable amount of
time, the importance of paternal affection continues to
be undiminished.

Adolescence is marked by sex consciousness in
social relations. Adolescents of the different sexes try to

Educational Psychology and

Human Growth and Development 35
mutually attract each other. But relations between boys
and girls are not very well defined during early
adolescences resulting in a lot of embarrassment in the
behaviour of youth. Popularity or unpopularity play a vital
part in adolescent adjustment. Self-assertiveness, social
insight, social competence, social discrimination or
snobbishness are all seen emerging during later
adolescence and ultimately adult social patterns develop.
Adolescent gangs are also powerful factors in
socialisation and peer group culture is dominant. This
may sometimes lead to antisocial or delinquent behaviour,
if not guided and properly sublimated. .

Developmenta! psychologists have listed certain
social characieristics of children at different stages of
development. Pre-school children have one or two friends
but change their friends easily as they are socially flexible.
Play groups at this stage are small and loosely organised.
Quarrels are frequent but are of short duration and quickly
forgotten. Dramatic play is frequent and awareness of
sex roles begins at this stage.

Primary class children appear to be more selective
in their choice of friends and like organised. games;
quarrels are still frequent and words are more often used
than physical aggression. Competition and. boasting are
often seen and boys and girls show different interests,
both in werk and play.

During elementary grades, the gang influence
becomes powerful. Interests of boys and girls become
more divergent. Team games are more popular.

During adolescence, peer group dominance
becomes more pronounced and concern for opposite sex
increases. At the end of adolescence, adult social patterns
come out. a .

4-49 Emotional Development from infancy to
Adolescence

The‘new born infant has a single generalised
emotional response of excitement only and out of this
gradually evolves increasing differentiated patterns of
emotional expression over the course of development.
in about 6 months, the child can express the three primary
emotions as described by Watson : :

- thwarting of appetites and restricting the free
bodily movements of the infant naturally makes
itangry;

- loud, harsh sound and sudden loss of support
evokes fear;

- Satisfaction of appetites, petting and fondling
produces love and joy.

Social factors, imitation and learning lead io a variety
of emotional reactions and expressions and by early
childhood most of the common emotions-affection,
elation, joy, anger, disgust, jealousy, fear, sympathy, etc.
are clearly discernible.

Pre-school children, because of their immaturity and
lack of control, tend to express their emotioris freely and
openly. Angry outbursts, which are seen frequently, are

Educational Psychology and a7
Human Growth and Develapment

caused by fatigue, hunger or needless adult interference.
As they are offen exposed to many strange situations,
they exhibit many fears and thelr imagination produces a
variety of irrational fears also in such children. Jeaiousy
ig equally common at this stage. Primary grade children
(between 6 to 9 years) are often alert to the feelings of
others; but they often hurt the feelings of other children.
They are very sensitive to criticism and need praise and
recognition. After the age of 9, conflict between group
codes of the peers and the adult rules often cause
emotional difficulties. :

Se

At the end of infancy, changes occur in the mode of
expression of emotional reaction. For example smail
infants express their emotion of anger through crying. At
the age 3, on becoming angry, infants start beating or
biting others. At the age of 4, they show their anger by
insubordination. At the age of 6. they vent their anger
through verbal abuses. Such patterns of change in
emotional reactions exhibited by children could be noticed
in other emotions aiso.

According to Frued there seems to be a twin faceted
emotional behaviour of individuals during infancy ard
early childhood. Male hildren display much affection
towards their mother. Though they have affection towards
their father, they also have jealousy and hatred towards
him, as they feel father has more concessions with the
mother, whom they love most (This is known as Oedipus
complex) Similarly in girls appear the opposing emotions
of love and hatred simullanecusly towards thelr mother.

eR
(This is known as Electra complex). If such ernotional
complexes are intense and persist for long, they may
affect the personality characteristics of the individuals
later on.

1:20 Stages of Moral Development in Children

Psychologists mention 4 stages in the moral
development in children. In the first stage, known as
‘Prudential Stage’ children’s behaviour is regulated by
means of pleasure and pain. Children learn those
behaviours that are rewarded and avoid these which are
punished. The second stage is the ‘Authoritarian Stage’
in which children follow the directions of his elders like
parents and teachers who have dominating influence over
the children. The third one is the ‘Social stage’ in which
children’s behaviour is governed by the social acceptance
or rejection. Children iry to behave in conformity with
social expectations. The level of moral development in
most of us get stagnated at this stage. The highest stage
of moral development is the ‘Personal Stage’ in which
an individual's behaviour is influenced by his conviction
of high morals and ethics. Even if the whole society
opposes him he will be steadfast in his action, if he thinks
his action is highly ethical i.e. he will be courageous in
his convictions.

1:20:1 Jean Piaget's Stages

Jean Piaget and Laurence Kohiberg have put
forward a development theory of morality. Piaget
‘distinguishes between ‘moral realism’ and ‘moral

Educational Psychology and 29
Human Growth and Development

relativism’. Young children are moral realists who
interpret moral rules and look at the material side of the
actions and their magnitude, ignoring the intentions of
the acts. Suppose a child is asked to pass moral
judgements on two acts. In the first case a child breaks
two tea cups while attempting to reach stealthily the
sweets kept over the cup board and in the second case a
servant maid breaks 4 tea cups due to carelessness while
serving tea to the visiting guests. The child will hold the
servant maid as more guilty than the stealing child
because of the magnitude of the act i.e. breaking ‘more
number of cups.

Only by about 11-12 years, do children become
capable of moral relativism. They are now capable to
decentre and think of several qualities at once and they
have overcome their ego centricism by becoming aware
that other people may have different points of view.

Consequently they take into account motives and

circumstances in making moral judgements. After the age
of 12 children behave in a conciliatory and forgiving way.

1:20:2 Kohlberg's Stages

& :
Kohlberg’s theory of moral development is based on

Piaget’s general theory of cognitive development
(Kohlberg believes that moral development, like cognitive
growth takes place through ‘assimilation’ and
‘accommodation’) He lay emphasis on the significance
of looking at things from other's point of view (role taking).
There are three levels of moral development.

|
4


============================================================
--- Page 28 ---
============================================================

49 Educational Psychology

In level 1, the preconventional level, Kohlberg
regards it is based on the desire to avoid punishment
and gain rewards. At level 1 there is no Internalization of
moral standards. At level 2, the conventional level,
although the chlid identifies with his parents and conforms
to what they regard as right and wrong, it is the motive to
conform rather than ethical standards that have been
internalized. It is only at level 3, ihe postconventional
level, that moral judgement is rational and internalized
and that conduct is controlled by an internalized ethical
code and is relatively independent of the approval or
castigation of others. At this level, moral conflict is
resolved in terms of broad ethical principles, and violating
these principles results in guilt and self-condemnation.

Like Plaget, Kohlberg also speaks of maturation as
the basis of moral growth; but mere maturation may not
help one to reach the higher levels of morality. The
individual must undergo life experiences that specifically
“confront him with more complex moral dilemmas and
with the realities of the social system in which he lives”.
These points are of relevance in planning a course of
moral education. Kohlberg advocates the existence of
some basic or universal moral values as all norma!
children everywhere go through the same stages of
cognitive development and interact socially in essentially
the same ways.

1:21 Period of Adolescence

The word ‘adolescence’ comes from the Latin verb

Educational Psychology and at
Human Growth and Development

‘adolescere’ which means ‘to grow’. So the essence of
the word adolescence is growth and it is in this sense
that adolescence represents a period of intensive growth
and change, in nearly all aspects of child's physical,
mental, social and emotional life.

Adolescence begins with the onset of puberty and
lasts tl ihe beginning of adulthood (12+ to 18/20). Several
physiological and psychological changes occur during this
period. The spurt in growth during adolescence starts with
the secretion of hormones from the ovaries, testes and
adrenal glands Into the blood stream and tissues.
According to Cole, adolescence is a period of growth in
ail systems of the body. In the course of a few years the
individual undergoes changes both in size and in his
internal body chemistry. The rapidity, variety and force of
these developments are amazing. The changes are so
extensive that some people call this as second birth.
Stanley Hail called this period as "period of storm and
stress”, a time when the individual is erratic, unstable
and unpredictable. But modern researches and
interpretations have made much of Hall's views obsolete. —
Brickson’s epigenetic model and self-concept
development have added new dimensions to the
interpretation of adolescence.

1:22. Special Characteristics of Adolescents

i) Rapid perplexing physical changes : Rapid
physical changes in physical appearance, development
of internal organs, functioning of sex organs facilitating


============================================================
--- Page 29 ---
============================================================

42 Educational Psychology
ee
the individual to acquire parent hood, physical strength
reaching its zenith etc. take place during adolescence.

ii) Heightend Self-consciousness : Adolescents
are highly anxious about the physical changes that take
place in them and try to present themselves most
attractive in all possible ways (hence referred to as an
age of self-decoration). They attempt to attract others
through their dresses, make-up, manner of talking,
walking etc.

iii) Intensification of sex-urge : Sex consciousness
becomes too intense at this time. Most of the adolescents’
problems are concerned with the sudden functioning of
their glands, secretion of sex hormones and the
awakening of the strong sex instinct.

iv) Craving for Independence : The adolescent is
on the boundary line demareating childhood from
adulthood. He is typically a person who needs security,
guidance and support from parents like a child and at the
same time he has independent views of his own; wishes
to have economic self-dependence and autonomy in his
functioning. He starts reacting strongly when parents and
elders treat him as a child. He tries to assert himself and
displays dissent to being controlled by powerful others.
He possesses a strange mixture of dependence and
independence which creates conflicting situations and
problems for him.

v) Peer - group relationship : Peer group
relationship plays a substantial role in the life of an

Educational Psychology and 43
Human Growth and Development .

adolescent. He gets distanced form his parents and elders
and spends much of his time with the members of his
peer group. He values the ideals of the group and
develops a sense of loyalty towards it; he is now directed
by the standard and norms of his peer group. When there
is a conflict between the demands of social and cultural
norms of adults and those of the peer groups, he gets
frustrated, which may at times lead to his maladjusted
behaviour. The group behaviour of adolescents in
schools/coileges is on any one of the two lines:
a) fun and joy through activities like singing,
dancing, playing, seeing movies, etc.
b) indulging in destructive activities like noisy
protests, strike, teasing others, etc.

vi) Idealism vs. Realism : A typical feature of

- adolescents lies in their interest in ideals. But in this

search of idealism they go away from realism. Lack of
experience makes him somewhat unrealistic. He tends
to accept the impossible. (eg. insisting that everyone
should come in the queue to receive their ration is
laudable; but denying exemption for the sick and the aged
from this rule reflects one's unrealistic attitude). When it
is not attainable he becomes disturbed and unreasonable.

vii) Vocational Choice and Need of Self-support :
The period of adolescence requires from the individuals
to decide about their vocations. Emotional instability, lack
of experience and maturity prove to be obstacles in
making the right choice. Moreover their interests,



============================================================
--- Page 30 ---
============================================================

B4 Educational Psychology

aptitudes and abilities, make them puzzled with respect
to exercising their vocational choice. in the absence of
proper guidance they may turn out to be misguided youth
indulging in anti-social activities.

vill) Aspiring for Leadership : Adolescents are
stimulated by idealism and aspire for democratic
leadership. They are unselfish, responsible and respect
other's points of view. These quailties of leadership are
preseni in them in a natural way which could be further
developed by entrusting to them the responsibility for
organising various ieam events like games, excursion,
debates, cultural competitions etc. within the school as
well as between schools, under the guidance of teachers.

1:23 Problerns of Adolescents

Adolescence is a period of stress and strain. All are
not able to smoothly cross over this stormy period of life.
important problems of adolescence are discussed below :

4:23:1 identity Crisis

Though an adolescent needs security, guidance and
economic support from his parents, still he tries to
establish to others that he has independent views,
maturity of opinion and relies on self-support like adult.
Thus his conflicting stances lead him to self-confusion
about his own identity @vhether he is a child or an adult).
During later adolescence, he slowly tries to come out of
this confusion about his self identity and develops his
own norms of behaviour and expectations; develops his
abilities and values. ;

Educational Psychology and 45
Human Growth and Development

1:23:2 Generation Gap

in today's changed world, there is a large gap
between the view points of the elders and youngsters of
this generation. Progress in science and technology and
the consequent increase in the life comforts of our
adolescents have brought in a sea change in ihe goals,
actions, ideals, interests, values and expectations of our
youngsters which has alienated them from the present
day elders. This alienation is termed as generation gap
which psychologists consider as responsible for the
conflicts between the adolescents and their eldels at
home as weil as in the society at large [(eg.) youngsters
want to pay respect to others, not on the basis of age or
seniority but due to efficiency, ability and performance
which is not agreeable to elders].

Rapid technological changes witnessed in our society
coupled with the craze for independence have
unfortunately contributed a lot to the denigration of our
age old customs, cultural traditions and values in the
midst of youngsters. Many a social institution like family
and school has undergone changes in their structure and
functioning, resulting in jncreased opportunities for our
adolescents to go astray and induige in smoking; drinking,
drugging, developing liberal sexuai relations etc.

1:23:33 Negative and Non-Conformist Attitude

In their attempt fo assert their individuality,
adolescents, oppose all the elders, particularly those who
control them. They question every social tradition and do


============================================================
--- Page 31 ---
============================================================

46 Educational Psychology

not meekly conform to ail social customs, which create
problems in their social adjustment.

1:23:4 Domination of Sexual Urge

The foremost problem in adolescence is the
excitement created due to the domination of sexual urge,
which leads to distraction and wastage of energy of ihe
youths.

1:23:5 Hesitation and Confusion in Selecting
a Vocation

As they are not sure about their own potentials,
interesis, abilities and aptitudes and also proper guidance
is not available in knowing about different occupations,
their nature and scope, requisite entry qualifications and
skills etc. adolescents appear to be highly confused in
their selection and preparation for future career.

1:23:6 Emotional Swings

Adolescents are highly restless, emotionally
perturbed and moody; without any proper reason, at one
time they appear to be elated and joyous and the next
moment highly depressed. Unfulfilled desires and

longings make them aggressive. As they aspire for those ©

beyond. their abilities and potentials, easily they get
frustrated. Adolescence is said to be a stage of
“ignorance of one’s practical world”.

1:23:7 Aspiring for Autonomy

Adolescents ardently wish to be liberated from
parental control and function independently. They feel

they are grown up and mature and also expect due
recognition from others. They display dissent to being
controlled or supervised. The greatest social problem of
adolescents is that they start questioning thelr parents,
become disobedient and protest strongly when being
controlled. In severe cases, they stay away from their
family or run away from the home.

1:23:38: Peer Group Dominance

Adolescents get distanced from their parents and
elders and spend much of their.time with the agemates
of their peer group. They value the ideals of ihe peer
group and develop a sense of loyalty towards it. Their
behaviour is directed by the standard and norms of the
peer group. in the company of bad friends, adolescents
derail in their social behaviour, at times leading to
delinquency. Hence parents are required to help their

- adolescent children in selecting their friends and

channelise the energy of the peer group in constructive
and creative activities.

1:24 Helping the Adolescents to Overcome
their Problems

The needs of the adolescents have to be satisfied
and their problems are to be realised in a proper way in
order to help them in growing and developing properly.
This difficult task requires the joint efforts of parents and
teachers. Below are some suggestions in this regard:


============================================================
--- Page 32 ---
============================================================

48 Educational Psychology

i) Te have the proper knowledge of adolescent's
psychology : Adolescence is the bridge between
childhood and adulthood. it is essential to have the
knowledge of the adolescent's psychology in order to
understand them and their problerns. They shouid be
treated sympathetically and helped to solve their problems
by offering proper guidance. They should be helped in
resolving their conflicts and overcoming frustrations.

ii) Providing sultable environment for proper
growth : Adolescence is the period when maximum
growth and development takes piace. To optimize this
development, sullabie environment should be provided
by the parents and teachers at home as well as in schools.
Adolescents must be provided with balanced diet; they
must be given knowledge of health and personal hygiene,
cleanliness, various diseases and their prevention etc.
to keep them fit and agile. Adequate provision for physical
exercise, games and recreations should be made in the
school curriculum and facilities made available. Making
use of thelr interests, curricular and co-curricular
experiences are to be planned and arranged.

il) Rendering proper sex education : Sex plays
dominant role during adolescence. As adolescents are
frightened by nocturnal emission/menstruation, they
_ should be provided with proper sex information and
education; or otherwise they may become victims of
exploitation by yellow journals, pseudo sexologists and
advertising agencies which provide half-backed
information on sex.

Educational Psychology and 49
Human Growth and Development

iv) Proper dealing with adolescents :

a) Parents and teachers should recognize the
importance of the peer group on modifying
adolescents’ behaviour.

b) Elders should not atiempt to thrust their views
and decisions on the adolescents; instead they
should try to convince them by their rational
arguments.

c) As adolescents crave for recognition, teachers
and parents should invite their views and ideas
and give due consideration and recognition.

d) As adolescents wish for social recognition,
rights and responsibilities, opportunities are to
be provided for them to carry out team work,
undertake field trips, participate in N.C.C.
Camps, fine arts etc; organise ‘school
celebrations and exhibitions and so on.

@) Teachers and parents should serve themselves
as role models for adolescents in the religious
and moral spheres, instead of criticising /
reprimanding them.

v) Training of emotions and satisfaction of
emotional needs : Adolescent youths are surcharged
with emotions, highly inflammable and restless. Their
emotions can be aroused with a slight provocation.
Political parties and opportunist leaders can easily befoo!
them and instigate them to indulge in strike and damage

erence  en
public properties. Therefore there is a strong need for
proper emotional education. Their emotions should be
properly trained and their emotional energies should be
diverted towards constructive ends. Provision in schools
for students’ self-government, fine arts association, radio-
club, science club, science exhibition etc. provide
opportunities for the youths to develop their organising
and leadership skills. Similarly participation in scouts,
N.C.G. social and community service, sports and games,
competitions, quiz etc. offer opportunities to develop their
abilities and interests.

vi) To take care of the special interests of the
adolescents : A great care should be taken to locate the
special interests and aptitudes of adolescents. According
to their interests and aptitudes they should be provided
with learning experiences and opportunities for
participation in co-curricular activities.

Their thirst for curiosity, wandering and adventure
should be quenched through excursion, N.C.C,
mountaineering, scientific exploration etc. Their love for
humanity and ideals should be utilised in rendering social
and community services like blood donation camps,
functional literary movements etc. in the neighbourhood
and distressed areas so as to make them constantly busy
and their mind pre-occupied with healthy and constructive
ideas.

vii} Providing Religious and Moral Education :
Opportunities should be provided for adolescents to

Educational Psychology and 52°
Human Grewth and Development

discuss religious and moral issues rationally. Emphasis
should be shifted from rituals to ideals, by facilitating a

comparative study of the tenets of some important worid

réligions. By nature, adolescents are hero worshippers.
{f we provide them with selected examples of saints and
prophets, religious and social reformers and great leaders
who sacrificed their lives in our struggle for independence,
iheir interests can be better served as they will imbibe

~~ many of the ideals of their heroes.

vill) Provision for Vocational Education «, As
adolescents aspire for economic self-dependence, they

_ should be provided with proper vocational guidance to

take up jobs during their holidays and vacations.
Vocational oriented curriculum at the secondary level will
be of great help in grooming the adolescents.

ix) Arranging Guidance Service : Adolescents are
at the cross-roads of life. Lack of guidance creates
feelings of insecurity ahd restlessness in them. Hence in
all high schools and colleges, guidance cells should be
established and made functional, offering educational,
vocational and personal guidances to our students ard
youths. *

1:25 Developmental Tasks

Every culture expects its members to master certain
essential skills and acquire certain appropriate behaviour
patterns at various ages during the life span. These tasks,
skills and behaviour pattern are essential to personal and
social adjustment at those ages and each cultural group



============================================================
--- Page 34 ---
============================================================

52 Educational Psychology
ee
expects its members to aquire these. For example all
children are expected to master the 3 R's (reading, writing
and counting) during their early childhood years.
Heavinghurst has labelled these as “Developmental
tasks”. Developmental task is “a task which arises at
a period in the life of an individual, successful
achievement of which leads to his happiness and
success with later tasks, while failure leads to
unhappiness and difficulty with later tasks”.
Developmental tasks are different for different
developmental periods of an individual namely, childhood,
adolescence, adulthood, middle age and old age. Some
developmental tasks arise purely from maturation (eg.
learning to walk), others arise from socio-economic
pressures (eg. learning to read) and a few may grow out
of personal values and aspirations of the individual
(eg. choosing some vocation). In most cases
developmental tasks arise from these forces working
together. Schools should help students to deal with the
tasks appropriate to their level of development.

The ages at which the social group expecis iis
members to master the developmental tasks of that age
are called critical ages. During such critical periods,
maturational factors predispose the individual to acquire
these patterns of behaviour which facilitate adjustment
to the society and external world. As values undergo
changes in society, some of the old accepted
developmental tasks get eliminated and may be replaced
by new tasks or their relataive importance may get
lessened. ;

Educational Psychology and 53
Human Growth and Development

1:25:71 Uses of the Knowledge of Developmental
Tasks

i) Developmental tasks are of value to the
individual in enabling him to know what is
expected of him by society at.a particular age.

ii) Parents who are aware of such developmental
tasks may teach them to their children so that
the children. may not experience failure and
unhappiness later.

iii) The developmental tasks show the individual
what lies ahead and what he will be expected
to do when he reaches the next stage of
development and this will eliminate much of the
difficulty and emotional stress in later
adjustment. For example, if.adolescents are
aware of the probelms and tasks that lie ahead,
they could be better prepared for them.

lf parents and teachers know the dévelopmental
tasks, then they can provide the necessary experiences
and training to children and ensure the children to behave
as per the expectations of the society and lead a
successful life. If any ghild is found to lay behind in
developmental tasks at a particular period, then it can be
provided with special education or training. For example,
we could often hear in our countryside old iadies and
grand mothers enquiring their relatives, “Has your child
completed two years of age? Is he talking now?” etc.

- This is done precisely for the purpose of knowing the

54 Educational Psychology

nee
developmental trend of the child. if a two year old child is
not talking, then it points out to the necessity of referring
the child to a doctor and procure the help of a speech
therapist.

1:25:2 Harms due to Insistence of Develop-
mental Tasks

i) Inappropriate expeciations : Developmental

norms may not hold good in the case of late or -

slow developing children like the retarded.
Further, showing disappointment when a
particular behaviour pattern does not show
itself in a child at the normally expected time
may result in feelings of inferiority and
consequent further retardation in the child.

ii) Among the developmental tasks, omitting a few
earlier one's and attempting to develop the next
higher. tasks in-children may prove to be
injurious for the proper development of the
child. For example, in some schools in their
over enthusiasm, in the middle of X1 Standard
without finishing the entire syllabus meant for
that class, they start teaching the syllabus of
XH Standard. This is highly injurious to the
proper intellectual development of children.

iii) When an individual passes from one
developmental stage to the next higher one,
his unique experiences and the resulting
frustration may sometimes prove to be harmful.

For example if a 25 year old lady does not
agree to marry or determines to remain
unmarried, then our society talks il of her,
considers her suffering from defects or illness.
This is because the developmental norm in our
society for a 25 year old girl is to get married.
This kind of criticism may lead to conflicts and
frustrations in the lady and her life may be
shattered.

with necessary basic skills and knowledge, due to their
age, thereby enabling them to lead a successful life. This
gigantic task is undertaken at different stages of
education viz. elementary, secondary, higher secondary
and higher education levels. As the rate of learning of an

intellectual development, itis the duty of the school to
arrange for adequate opportunities for the child and
motivate him to acquire the requisite knowledge and basic

skills at every stage of education. Educationists should:

take special care in designing the school curriculum for
different classes ensuring it to be broadbased and
capable of providing variety of experiences. through
curricular and co-curricular activities. The knoweldge of
developmental tasks enable the lead players in education
viz. parents and teachers to understand the complexities
involved in the teaching - learning process and develop
that of an allround personality in the child. This make
them realise the importance of children participating in
sports and games, physical exercises and various co-
curricular activities as well as the need for cultivating
personal health and hygiene.

Unit - ll
ATTENTION, PERCEPTION AND MEMORY

2:00 Introduction

In this unit, Meaning and Definition of the mental
process ‘attending’, its nature, Types of attention,
Determinants of attention, Ways and means of securing
better attention in the class, Meaning of sensation and
perception and the factors which affect perception, Laws
of perception, Meaning of memory, Kinds of memory,
Factors affecting memory, signs of Good memory and
Techniques of promoting better memory are to be
discussed.

2:01 Meaning of Attention

Modern psychologists, who believe in the integrated
functioning of the mind, do not consider ‘attention’ as an
independent faculty or unique power of mind. As itis a
process or an activity of the mind, it is better to speak of
‘attending’ rather than ‘attention’. If we are clear that what
we are speaking of, is an ongoing process. or activity,
then it is alright to*use either of these terms
synonymously, for the sake of easy expression and
convention. Whenever we are awake or conscious, we
seem to be attending to something or other, as the mind
when active, has to attend on some stimulus. As William
James pointed out, field of attention and consciousness
are not identical; only a few contents in the field of our
consciousness are selected and attended to. Others


============================================================
--- Page 40 ---
============================================================

64 Educational Psychology

i
though experienced by us, may not be clearly and
distinctly felt by us. Figuratively, we can speak of a margin
(fringe) and focus (central area of clearness) in our field
of consciousness. The terms ‘Figure’ and ‘Ground’ used
by Gestalt Psychologists almost correspond to the focus
and margin respectively. Stimuli that are attended to are
in the focus while others lie in the margin of our conscious
field. The focus and margin alternate; i.e. the stimulus
now in focus may drift to the margin and may be replaced
by some other stimulus, which was earlier in the margin.

2:01:1 Definition of Attention —

‘Attending’ can be defined as the mental activity of
focusing on certain aspects of one’s current experiences
and ignoring others. Attending may be considered as a

kind of mental set which predisposes the individual to.

concentrate upon one and screen out others. Such
attentive sets involve not only mental selectivity but
receptor adjustment (focusing our eyes oF turning our
head), general postural adjustment (leaning forward),
muscle tensions, etc. As such there appears to be
affective and conative aspects to the cognitive activity
attending. MeDougall defines ‘attending’ as ‘striving to
cognize’. Attention increases one’s efficiency and is vital
for acquisition of skills. It is also an aid to remembering
and recall.

2:02 ‘Types of Attention
Attention are of two kinds.

i. Voluntary or Volitional Attention
ii. Involuntary or Non-Volitional Attention

Attention, Perception and Memory 65

Involuntary attention is spontaneous, free, natural
and passive. Not much effort is needed for this type of
attention. Attention of young chiidren is of this nature.

This type of attention invoives some effort or will,
Some times we have to force ourselves to attend to
objects or events in which we lack interest. In such cases,
we take efforts to set our attention on the stimulus in
question. Thus we can say voluntary attention is
intentional. .

Sometimes effort is required.to initiate or start
attending, which once it has got a start through effort,
then goes on effortlessly. Far example, it may require
effort on our part to. start reading a new book. Once
started reading, we may be absorbed in reading, if the
book is well written. This type of attention triggered by
effort, is known as ‘implicit Volitional Attention’. In
another type of voluntary attention, effort may be required
continuously to start as well as sustain attention
throughout the activity. Such type of attention is called
‘Explicit Volitional Attention’. ‘Most of the. activities
carried out without much interest, belong to this category.

What is sometimes referred: to as ‘habitual
attention’ is akin to involuntary attention, as habitually
attending to something may make it automatic aftersome -
time. (e.g. the bus drivers attending to traffic signals).
Even in voluntary attention, interest is present, as without
some interest we will not aliend. In such cases, interest
is of an indirect nature rather than direct and immediate.

2-03 Nature / Characteristics of Attention
The following are the characteristics of attention.

i) Attention is a Selective Process: Attention is a
process of selection among items not yet entered in
the field of conciousness, a selection of some items
(stimuli) to enter conciousness while others remain
excluded.

ii) Attending is the first step in the mental process
of knowing called ‘Cognition’. Perception is the
function of attention.

iii) Attention is three dimensional i.e. attention is not
only a mental selectivity but it also involves
affective (emotion related) and conative (related
to motor activity) aspects, in the cognitive activity
attending. McDougall defines ‘attending’ as
‘Striving’ to Cognize a stimulus clearly’.

iv) Attention needs motor-adjustment like turning our
head, focussing our eyes, leaning forward etc.

v) Attention is not divisible i.e. we cannot attentively
do two things at the same time. If we try to attentively
do. two things at a time, both the activities will
suffer. :

vi) Attention is fluctuating in nature. We cannot be
attending continuously on any object for more than
10 seconds because attention shifts from one object
to another or one aspect of the object to another
aspect.

Attention, Perception and Memory 67

vii) Span of attention is limited. Span of attention
refers io the number of independent, distinct or
separate stimuli that can be attended to by an
individual, at a glance. Experiments reveal that the
adult span of attention is between 6 to 8, for
ungrouped dots.

vili) Internal factors like one's mental set, need,
interest, mood and physiological conditions of an
individual and external factors (or stimulus related
factors) like size, intensity, contrast, change,
novelty, movement, repetition etc. areuthe
determinants of attention.

ix) Interest and efforts play significant role in
attending to an object:

The reason behind our attention to an object is, that it
appears attractive to us and we are also interested in it.

2:04 Determinants of Attention
if attention is a process of selection, then the
question arisés on what basis is this selection made?

Actually there are many factors which determine the
process of attending. Those factors which reside in the

object attended to, are catled objective factors. As these
' factors operate on the individual from outside, they are

also known as ‘external’ factors. These factors include

size, intensity, contrast, novelty, movement, frequency

of repetition and systematic form of stimulus. The
Psychology of advertising makes good use of these
objective factors and the teacher also has to use them

_ profitably in the classroom.



============================================================
--- Page 42 ---
============================================================

68 Educational Psychology

eee tent i A

One may attend to objects, even when many or most
of the objective factors are absent. This is made possible
due to the factors that operate from within the individual.
These factors, such as interest, relevance or need, menial
set, mood and the physiological condition operating from
within the individual are known as ‘subjective’ or
‘internal’ factors.

Determinants of Attention

Objective factors Subjective factors

2:04:1 External Factors of Attention

Even if a person is not interested in any event or
object, certain characteristics of the object or event may
compel him to attend to it. Such object - related factors
are external factors of attention : They are :

i. Size : Objects of big size, arrest our attention
immediately. Full page advertisements in
newspapers capture our attention more easily
than quarter page advertisements. For the
same reason, people compete in putting up

Attention, Perception and Mernory 69
mente niin
large cut outs of political leaders, advertisement
hoarding etc. along the roadside.

ii. Intensity : As size is to figure, so is the intensity:
to the quality of the stimulus. Stimulus with high
intensity like loud sound, deep striking colours,
punchant smell etc. are highly successful in
attracting our attention. While taking a class, if
the teacher raises his tone he can overcome the
disturbing noises coming from outside and retain
the attention of his pupils on the ongoing lesson
in the class. Ma

iii. Change : Whenever there occurs sudden change
ina stimulus, it immediately attracts our attention.
For example when the fan suddenly stops,
everyone in the class looks up and see the fan.
Similarly a student sleeping in the class wakes
up immediately when silence suddenly descends
on the class. On entering into our house, we
quickly notice the changed positions of tables and
chairs in the hall. This implies that if a teacher
talks with proper modulation in his voice, he can
easily capture the attention of the students.

iv. Contrast : When‘a stimulus presents itself as a
contrast in the midst of other stimuli, it turns out
to be an attention winner e.g. A black dot in a
white shirt looks predominant. The reason for
drawing the median line on the tar road in yellow
colour, men wearing a deep coloured trouser and
light coloured shirt, writing on the blackboard with



============================================================
--- Page 43 ---
============================================================

70

Educational Psychology

vi.

white chalk etc., is to capture our attention
through the contrasting nature of the stimuli
involved. To arrest the attention of students in
the class, the teacher should use contrasting
activities like lecturing, questioning, using charts
and writing on the blackboard while teaching. °

Novelty : When a stimulus is presented in a novel
or unusual way, it attracts the attention of
everyone. For example, we used to see usually
the notice “No admission” in offices; but in an
office when we see the same notice in a different
manner like “Admission with permission only” it
immediately strikes our attention and retained in
memory for long. Similarly, when we see the
writing “Don’t kiss me please” on the back of a
lorry instead of the usual writing “Please keep
sufficient distance”, it quickly arrests our
attention. In a similar way, while teaching in the
class if the teacher instead of using the examples
given in the text book, presents illustrations from
his personal experiences, and that. too relating
to pupils immediate environment, then students’
attention will not get out of the class.

Movement : As compared to stationary objects,
moving objects easily attracts our attention. For
this reason only, the mother of a crying. child, to
divert its attention, points out to the child moving

objects like a crow, car, aeroplane and the like.

Similarly to win the attention of the people,

vii.

vill.

Attention, Perception and Memory Fi

advertisers display hoardings with neon lights that
alternately light.up and put off so as to give ihe
appearance of movement. The classroom teacher
should also present stimulus variation like moving
to the blackboard to write, moving towards
students while questioning, using appropriate
gestures while talking etc. and win the attention
of the pupils.

Repetition : A stimulus, even of low intensity if
appears repeatedly, it succeeds in. winning our
attention. The same. business advertisement is
repeated many times in mass media like T.V,
Radio and news papers only to. attract the
attention of consumers. Human nature is to notice
that stimulus which appears again and again. To
focus the attention of the. students on any
important concept.of the lesson the teacher
should explain it two or three times. with the use
of differeni Hlustrations and.that too through
different words:

Systematic Form : Objects with systematic form
are easily attended to and retained long in our
memory as compared to objects which are
incompiete or irregular in form. (e.g. We listen to
a faint tune even in noisy surroundings). To enlist
the attention of the students, the teacher before
starting the lesson should give an over- view of
the entire iesson so that ihe siudents get a proper
and complete idea of the lesson.

The foliowing are some of the important factors of

internal Factors of Attention

attention which operate from ‘within’ us.

Interest : This plays an important role in eliciting
the attention of the grown up adults. One attends
to something when it matters to him intensely
even though none of the objective factors are
present. One’s interest which composes one’s

dominant motivational system determines what - _

one attends to. The attention of violinist walking
along the bazaar is struck at the shop selling
musical instruments, particularly violins. Every
student during admission to college applies to
courses of his interest. Students develop certain
skills on the basis of their interest. (e.g. Musical
talent, vocational skill, mathematics ability,
science talent etc. get developed on the basis of
interest of individual students). Interested
students keenly observe the lessons in the class.
Teachers should always teach in such a way as
to kindle the interest of the students.

i. Need or value : Another important subjective

factor determining attention is ‘Need’, For
example, the attention of a person waiting for bus
of a particular route will always be restricted to
buses of that route only. A hungry person easily
spots the name board of a restaurant, though it
is small in size, appears dull, but the name board
ofa nearby bookshop which is big in size may

Attention, Perception and Memory 73

not catch his attention. Hence if the teacher
before starting a lesson in the class points out
the utility of the concepts to be taught, then
students will foliow the ciass with much attention.

Mental Set : One’s mental set or disposition of
readiness to react to a particular stimulus, is
another subjective factor of attention. For
example the attention of a person who goes to
railway station to receive his friend will always
be on spotting the friend in the midst of others;
he may not even hear if somebody nearby. cails
him. The reason for this is that his mind is set
only to receive his friend. For. this reason only,
Herbart stressed the importance of preparing the
students for ithe lesson at the start of the class,
before actually teaching the lesson.

iv. Physiological condition : The physiological

condition of one’s body also determines the level
of attention. Students suffering from headache,
stomachache, fever etc. will be unable to attend
to the lesson taught in the class. Itis always better
to provide rest for those students who do not feel
well, instead of compelling them fo attend the
class. :

2:05 Ways and Means of Securing Better

Attention in the Ciass

1) To secure attention of pupils, teacher has to first

of all remove certain obstacles io attention. Poor physical
conditions of pupil, fatigue, sensory defects, etc. interfere


============================================================
--- Page 45 ---
============================================================

74 Educational Psychology

a
with attention. Unhygienic seating, uncomfortable
furniture, inadequate lighting, etc. also hinder attention.

2) The teacher has to make good use of the objective
factors of attention in his class. Loud voice, striking
diagrams, clear blackboard work, use of coloured chalks,
varied activities, novel illustrations, repetition of basic
- ideas, etc. are all of such nature.

3) At the elementary stage the teacher has to appeal
to the involuntary attention by using concrete aids, direct
experiences, play activities, appealing to the children’s
curiosity, etc. At the middle school level teachers can use
suitable techniques of motivation by stimulating acquired
interest of pupils, their hobbies, etc. to evoke voluntary
attention and foster sentiments of love for various school
subjects and activities. At the adolescent level, voluntary
attention has to be evoked by appealing to the long-term
interests of students and banking on ineir self-regard.

4) During classroom teaching. the teacher has to tell
his. pupils what to attend to. at the stage of introduction
itself by providing ihe over-view of the lesson, While
explaining a new concep, the sr sould reiale it to
the previous knowledge of the studenis and give
examples which are familiar to them (preferably spotting

them from the day to-day life situations).

5) The teacher should harness the natural interests
of pupils to the class lesson and also create new interests
of educational value. Children’s interests vary with age:
but generally all children are interested in creative,
procuctive, free and life-like activities. So there is need

for play way methods, projects, discovery approach to
teaching, activity based curriculum, etc.

2:06 Sensory Organs and Sensations

It is said that sense organs are the gateways of
human knowledge, as we get the information and
knowledge about the externa! world, only though our
sense organs. We establish contact with the world around
us by seeing, hearing smelling, tasting and touching and
adapt the appropriate reactions towards different objects,
persons, events etc. ,

Oa

Sensation produced by different sense organs are
indicated below :

Visual stimuli -» eyes -» Aural (or visual) sensation -» Seeing
Auditory stimuli ~» ears -» Auditory sensation -» Hearing
Fragrance / odour emanating stimuli -» Nose —» olfactory -»Smelling
Taste Stimuli » Tongue ~» Gustatory sensation -» Tasting
Tactile stimuli -» Skin —» Tactile sensation -» Feeling of touch.

2:06:1 Sensation

Sensation is the immediate result of a sense
organ being acted upon by appropriate stimuli. They
are the various qualities of experience that are derived
from the stimulation of the sense organs or receptors.
Sensations are qualitative differences experienced by us
with reference to quantitative stimuli that impinge on our
sense organs. The stimuli are energy waves that produce
an experience and these are transformed by the sense
organs into pulses of energy in the nervous system.


============================================================
--- Page 46 ---
============================================================

76 Educational Psychology

2:07 Perception

Perception is a psychological process in which the
sensory inputs received from the sense organs are
processed, organised and interpreted based on the past
experiences of the organism so that the nature of the
stimuli are meaningfully understood.

Perception is the process of transforming sensory
inputs to which we attend, into organised impressions
that we experience. Mental interpretation of sensation
results in perception. So, Perception = Sensation +
Meaningful interpretation.

For example, the smell we experience due to the
burning of an object is sensation and understanding that
the burning object is rubber is perception. For this
perception to occur, we should have already experienced
the smell due to the burning of rubber and retain it in our
memory. .

2:08 Determinants of Perception

The stimuli present in one's environment, produce
sensations and they constitute the objective elements of

perception. The interpretation given for the sensations

are due to the subjective elements of perception. Mental
set, concepis previously associated with the sensory
input, attitudes, ongoing needs etc. al! influence. our
perceptual experience. That is why the same stimulus is
perceived differently by different persons.

2:09:1 Law of Pragnanz
According to Gestalts, perceptual organisation is
governed by the law of pragnanz.- ‘Pragnanz’ means

‘compact but significant’. \n perceiving, we do not add
the different sensations received and edit them so as to


============================================================
--- Page 47 ---
============================================================

78 Educational Psychology

Ee
get at the meaningful interpretation of the object
perceived. We always perceive any thing as a whole
configuration or pattern so that it is simple, meaningful
and stable. For example, on seeing a man riding a cycle,
we do not perceive the cycle and the rider separately; it
appears as a whole unit to us. The mental act of
‘organising’ takes place during perception as per the
law of pragnanz. Similarly on seeing the following figure

we do not say as a collection of a circle, triangles,
squares, rectangle, arc etc.; instead we say it as a human
face. Thus we perceive everything as a whole and not its.
parts and bits.

2:09:2 Law of Proximity

According to this law, perceptual groups are favoured
according to the nearness of the parts. This means that
we perceive all closely situated or located things as a
group. Similarly the 12 parallel lines drawn below are
preceived by us as four groups of 3 lines each.

|
2:09:3 Law of Similarity

_ Wertheimer stated this law as "other things being
equal, the stimuli that are similar, will have greater
tendency to be grouped as a single unit". For example,

2:09:4 Law of Closure

Se,

This law indicates that closed or
completed figures are more stable than
incomplete or unclosed figures and
hence our mind fills up the gaps if any

and perceive the object as whole and
complete. For example, we perceive the figure given here
as a triangle, though there are gaps between the lines.For
this reason only, while proof reading, missing letters
escape from our attention as our mind fills up the gaps
and reads it correctly. Similarly when we read _a letter
written by us, we overlook the mistakes in it but if the
letter is given to others and read, they immediately notice
the mistakes.

2:09:5 Law of Good Continuation

It indicates that organisation in perception appears
to be going infinitely in the same direction. So, there is a
tendency for factors to give direction, movement and

only, cinema scenes though shot individually, when they

are run in a sequence at the rate of 15 frames per second,
they appear to be one and continuous.

2:10 Errors in Perception

Our perception is not always true and accurate.
Sometimes errors do creep in our perception when
our mind wrongly interprets the sensory input, which is
otherwise known as ‘llusion’.

2:10:1 llusion

liusions are wrong or mistaken perceptions which
fail to correspond with the situation as objectively
assessed. lilusions arise either because of the ambiguous
qualities of what is perceived or the state of the perceiving
person or both. For example, during night we mistake a
rope lying in the backyard for a snake. Similarly to a
person searching for a missing round 50 paise nickel coin,
even a small round tin plate will appear to be the coin.
Trees appear to be moving around, fo a passenger of a
moving train, appearance of our stationary train moving
slowly when the other train nearby starts moving, are all
due to illusion. illusions are of different types:

i) ilusion of movements (eg. A spot of light in dark
appears to be moving around)

ii} Hlusion of perspectives (eg. Two parallel lines
appear to meet at a long distance)

2:10:2 Hailucination

Hallucination is faise perception; it is different from
illusion in that, it has no sensory basis and‘it is a dream
like image often mistaken for perception. For example,
the phenomenon, of ‘Mirage’, spotting a ghost on the
tamarind tree in the outskirts of a village, hearing the
tapping sound of the house door, hearing the anklet sound
of an angel etc. are all due to hallucination. Illusions do
have apparent external stimuli but hallucinations do not
have a stimulus object. All experience illusions but few
(generally mentally ill and those under the influence of
drugs) experience hallucinations. The same situation
arouses the same illusion in all subjects, but hallucinations
occur under particular circumstances in different
individuals.

1) Memory can. be Incidental or intentional.
Intentional. memory which involves closer.attention paid
to. the material memorized; greater rehearsal and greater
tendency to categorize.material and find relationship and
association between items,.is superior to a casual
remembrance of observed events which is inciden‘al
memory.

_ 2)Memory can also be classified in tetms of degree
to which it resembles the original perception, as vivid
memory or indistinct memory. indistinct memories
influence our behaviour without our awareness.

3) Memory can be observational memory or rote
memory. Observational memory is for concrete objects

and events (e.g. Evidence of a witness to bomb explosion)
and rote memory is for words and symbols. Generally by
memory we seem to refer to rote memory and verbal
learning implies this aspect.

4) Memory can also be classified in terms of duration
of the retention period as Short term memory (STM) or
Long term memory (LTM)

2:12:1 Short and Long Term Memories

Short term memory, also called primary or working

memory, lasts for 15 to 30 seconds. We remember a

telephone number till we get the connection to that
number. We have to look at the. telephone directory, if

we are to phone after a few hours. Experimental ;

evidences show that only 7£2 separate items can be held
in short term memory af one time (referred to as Memory
span). Primary memory is not the terminal point.
Information is being transformed to long term memory
for more permanent storage. The multiplication tables we
have learnt, the poem we have memorised, our date. of
birth, wedding day, our telephone number, residential
address etc. are permanently remembered because of
our long term memory.

More time and effort are essential for moving
information into long term storage. While the capacity
for STM is limited, the capacity for LTM is unlimited. The
information passed on to LTM is placed into organised
categories, where.it resides, almost permanenily. There
appear to. be different brain processes for STM and LTM.
The transfer from STM to LTM takes place not only

Attention, Perception and Memory a.

because of rehearsal and repetition but because of
coding which is the process of analysing. information and
compressing it into abbreviated form.

The operations and control process effected by the
brain in dealing with the input information passed on to it
by the receptors of our sensory organs with respect to
STM and LTM seem to-be different as illusirated by the

are momentarily forgotten. Those information entering

into STM are immediately put into use and after that
forgotten or if considered useful and to be aetained
permanently, it is processed further so-as to put into
organised categories. and. codified. and. stored
permanently (over one minute up to many years) in the
_LTM. Acertain.amount of time (about 30 minutes) appears
to be needed in transferring information from STM to LTM.
(For example, one who has received, a jolt of the brain

often does not remember the events that just preceded

the accident but will remember those that happened 30
minutes. earlier) When we remember anything,
information is retrieved from L.T.M and put back into
S.T.M. for further processing (rehearsal and repetition),
after which the information may be again put back in
LT.M. or it may result in a response. or output. Therefore
it could be inferred that information, depending on their
degree of utility, are stored either in S.T.M. or LT. M. by
different brain processes. That is why telephone numbers
of other people are registered in our S.T. M. but telephone
numbers of our residence and office are stored in our
L.T.M.

attitude, concentration, interest, degree of anxiety,

So retentivity, the core of memory, continues to be
puzzling and not fully understood yet.

2:14 ~Signs of Good Memory

Psychologists point .out the» followingsfive
characteristics as hall marks of good memory.

1. Rapidity : One is said to have good memory, if he
could recollect his past experiences very quickly.

2. Accuracy : if one could bring back the learned
_ materials without any-distortion, he is said to have good
memory.

3. Length of Time : How long ene could retain the
learned Materials in memory before retrieving them is
also taken as a measure of good memory. —

4. Promptness of retrieval : If one is able to bring
back the learned matetials instantly with ease without
requiring any heip, he is said to have. a. goat memory.

5. Serviceableness : This refers to the recall of right
thing at the right place. Ifa candidate. is not able. to.tell
the correct answer at the time of intervi f what will.be
of use if he’could recollect the correct answer after coming
out of the interview?

2:15 Techniques of Promoting Better
‘Memory’

The capacity to retain cannot be improved by any
intrinsic manner. All that can be done is to improve the
methods of memorising. A good memory depends upon
a good brain. We shouid try to keep the metabolism of
the brain in-a good condition. Our diet should contain
calcium and phosphorous-rich products. Some tips to
improve memory through better memorising techniques
are given below :

i. Have the desire or motivation to learn, whatever
is learnt.

ii. Meaningful material is learnt quickly and
retained longer.

ili. Follow: SQ3R method while learning (survey,
questioning, recite, repeat and review)

iv. Spacing the learning periods appropriately will
help effective learning -

v. Recitation during the course of learning helps
self-evaluation. This is very useful in
memorizing, particularly in children

vi. Over-learning (learning beyond the point of

forgetting) aids retention.

vii. Rhymes and logical associations between
“different parts of the material help
remembering.

vill.

xi,

xil,

Attention, Perception and Memory BS:

Mnemonic devices (artificial associations tiké
abbreviations) are useful in learning when no
inherent organisation or association could be
seen in the material. For example to remember
the colours in a rainbow in the order, we use
the artificial word VIBGYOR.

Multisensory learning is more effectively
remembered (T.V. advertisements are
remembered better than those of Radio).

Periodical rest and sleep immediately-after
learning improve retention by Helping
consolidation of memory traces. Subjects which
interfere with each other should not be learnt
in succession.

Subjects of study should be so arranged to
avoid interferences like Pro-active and: Retro-
active inhibitions (e.g. After learning
mathematics study a language like Tamil or
English; followed by the study of science, then
learn social studies or any other light subject.

As suggested by Mandler and Herbart,
teachers shoyld plan the instruction such that
information. is: provided. in organised. manner
(i.e. grouping them in suitable clusters or
categories). In this connection ‘Ausubel also
talks about ‘advanced organisers’. Learning
through concept maps is an attempt under this
principle of organisation.

Learning in Human Life, Nature of Learning, Factors

Learning Theories, Learning theories propounded by
Thorndike, Paviov, Skinner , Jean Piget, John Dewey and
Carl Rogers and their educational implications, are taken
up for detailed discussion.
3:01 Meaning and Definition of Motivation
Motivation is the process of arousing,
maintaining and controlling interest ina goal directed
pattern of behaviour. Motivation is basic to all behaviour
including learning. It is concerned with the ‘why’ of
behaviour. The success in life and learning depends on

our motivation. It stimulates us and directs our behaviour. -

Good motivation in any activity ensures that we
develop an interest in the activity, feel an urge to do it,

Motivation and Learning | 88

pay attention to it and the resulting performance is quick
and efficient. On the other hand, ff there is poor
motivation, we feel the activity is forced on us against
our desire. We may somehow do it or learn it ina
haphazard way but our attention to the task will be
minimum, mistakes will occur in plenty and performance
will also be poor. The most important reason for the gap
between pupil’s potential and the current level of
achievement lies in the area of motivation. According to
Crow and Crow, “Motivation is considered with the
arousal of the interest in learning and to the extent is
basic to learning”. An understanding of the nature of -
motivation, types of motivation and the innovative ability
to make the best use of motivating influences to foster
pupils’ learning are vital to teachers if they hope to get
each pupil te make maximum use-of his or her talents.

Further it helps the teacher to know pupils’ appetites and

desires i.e. to become sensitive to pupils’ needs.
3:02 Definition of Motives

Motives generally refer to biological, social and
learned factors that initiate, sustain and stop goal
directed behaviour of organisms. Motives may be
physiological or psychotogical and-act from within the
organism. The term ‘Motive’ in its root Latin means ‘to
move’ or ‘to impel’. Thus an organism acting with a motive
exhibits a specific behaviour and strives to reach the goal,
appropriate to the motive.

Tolman speaks of motives as tendencies io strive
for goals. Hebb defines motives as evenis which arouse



============================================================
--- Page 55 ---
============================================================

94 Educational Psychology

an organism to action. A motive creates a state of
disequilibrium or tension within the organism and thus
initiates and sustains a particular type of activity which
would lead to restoration of equilibrium by the
attainment of the goal central to the motive. So
‘disequilibrium’ and ‘tension’ appear to be basic to
motivation.

Motives do not themselves lend to direct observation.
They are inferred from the manifest behaviour or from
the verbal repoits. For example a student's plunging into
intensive study will reveal his motive for achievement.
Motives also enable us to predict behaviour.

3:03 Characteristics of Motives
By analysing the definitions of motivation given by

different psychologists, we can infer the following
characteristics :

i. Motivation is a psychological process (internal)
ii, This internal process jis inifiated by some need or
want : .
ii. ‘It-directs our efforts towards the goal that satisfies

the need; i.e. it helps tis to select the appropriate
behaviour so as to reach the goal.

iv.. It brings energy mobilisation in us

vy. ft helps to sustain the attention in one’s efforts or
task

vi. Restless to achieve the goal stops a after the goal is
reached.

Motivation and Learning

lt creates interest in learners as a farmer in his
farming. It energises man to act and to make constant
efforts in order to satisfy his basic motive. .

3:04 - Kinds of Motives

Motives may be broadly classified as (i) natural or
‘biogenic and (ii) acquired or sociogenic. Biogenic
motives (e.g. hunger, thirst, sex, escape from pain etc.)
are unlearned and they are referred as ‘Primary
Motives’. Sociogenic motives often referred as
Secondary Motives’ are acquired and they are
essentially social in character. Animal behaviour is mainly
based on primary motives. Apart from primary motives,
secondary motives too play « a significant role in human
behaviour.

Secondary motives may be classified into three fold
as {a) Motives related to Psychological needs (b) Motives
related to Social Needs (interaction with. othe!
and (c) Motives related to Competency and S Self (Personal
Motives) : a

3:05 Theories of Motivation

The process of motivation (how motives arise and
control the behaviour) has been explained by different
psychologists. While behaviourists emphasize extrinsic
motivation, cognitive theorists advocate intrinsic
motivation. The follewing are.the important theories of
motivation:

Thus his hierarchy of human needs can be
represented pyramidically.as foliows :

1. instinct Theory of McDougall

2 Morgan's Physiological Theory (Hypodermic Model)
3. Hull's Drive - reduction Theory

4. Murray's Need Theory

5. Maslow's Theory of Hierarchial Needs

Among these theories, Masiow’s theory of hierarchial
needs has been taken up for detailed discussion here.

3:05:71 Maslow’s Theory of Hierarchical Needs

; ic. Pca
Abraham Maslow proposed a comprehensive theory Nag ANE =

of need gratification and growth motivation, including
fundamental physiological needs, intermediate needs and
what-are called.meta needs which a person is able to
aitend to only when his lower order needs are satisfied.
Such meta needs are of creativity and self-actualisation.
According to Maslow :

1. Physiological needs :

These are the lower in the motivational hierarchy,
which include need fortfood, water, oxygen. sleep, sex,
sensory satisfaction and the like: These are vitalfor
‘survival and-hence should -be fulfilled before the next
higher order motives become prominent. Perhaps the
main reason-why disadvantaged and poor children refuse
to be. motivated in the classroom to learn: is that their
basic bodily needs remain unsatisfied. _

EPS

i, Human needs are many and multiple; all are not of
equal importance, i.e. needs can be arranged
hierarchially.


============================================================
--- Page 57 ---
============================================================

98 Educational Psychology

lL Safety and Security needs :

They include shelter, clothing and personal safety,
security of the future, routine, regularity etc. Children do
need discipline within their levels of understanding in
order to perceive an orderly and organised world.

lll. Affiliational needs :

It refers to the individual's hunger for - affection. “A
pupil who is not loveable because of his behaviour,
needs to be loved most”. Identity implies belongingness
and often underachievement of certain pupils results from
lack of love and belonging.

IV. Self-Esteem needs :

in all of us there is a desire for strength, mastery,
competency etc. leading to a feeling of independence
and freedom. We want to be high in the eyes of others.
According to Maslow, satisfaction of this self-esteem
need generates feeling of worth, confidence and
adequacy. Lack of satisfaction of this need results in
discouragement, feelings of inferiority and inadequacy.

V. Achievement needs :

They may.be classified as need for knowledge and
the need for understanding. Need for knowledge is
satisfied when there is access to information, knowing
how to do things, meaning of things, events, symbols
etc. Néeds for understanding implies knowledge of
relationships, process, the integration of knowledge into

Motivation and Learning a9
Sn. ci
broad structure etc. Thus achievement needs are related
fo intellectual domination and cognitive competencies.

Vi. Aesthetic needs :

This is concerned with appreciation of order and
beauty. One whose lower order needs. are fully satisfied
or known that he need not bother about them, derives
pleasure in beauty, nature etc. Tagore, Wordsworth etc.
are the best examples for this. ;

VIL Self-Actualisation needs =

Self actualisation means to fulfill one’s individual

nature in ail its aspects. One who is talented in one

specific area feels uneasy, if that talent is not nurtured
and utilised. He wants fo. attain perfection in that area.
The highest level of functioning : occurs when a person is
self-actualised. People can. be. motivated. towards self-
actualisation only when the lower. order needs are

Satisfied. .

3:05:1:01 Educational Implications of
Maslow’ s Theory. .

_ The idea that the deficiency needs of pupils are to
be satisfied to enable them to function at a higher
level of motivation has to be borne in mind when
dealing with economically and culturally
disadvantaged children.

psychological safety and showing interest in every
pupil so that he feels that he belongs to the class
are vital.

iii, An individual tends to raise his goals after success
and lower them after failure; so teachers should
maintain realistic level of aspiration by providing

-graded assignments ensuring to include certain
amount of success for every pupil.

iv. The teacher should enhance the attraction and
minimise the dangers of growth needs.

v. Indiscipline in classrooms and campus unrest could
be traced to the fact that our curriculum is by and
large not related to the demands of the society and

aspirations of the people. The uncertain future
makes the students behave hysterically at times.
Therefore the curriculum should be drastically
-changed-and periodically revised so that it serves
the vocational needs. of pupils.

3: 06 Concept of ‘Level of Aspiration’

Frank defines level of aspiration as “the level of
future performance in a familiar task which an
individual, knowing his level of past performance in
the task, explicitly undertakes to reach”... P.Hoppe
defines it as “the degree of accomplishment
consciously striven after by an individual”. Generally
normal people set their level of aspiration little above their
present level of performance, raise it after success and

Motivation and Learning

108

lower a little after experiencing failure. Abnormal people
and people dominated with excessive fear of failure set
their future goals either unrealistically too high or low.

Personality factors such as N.Ach, self confidence,
maturity, self-esteem etc. seem to influence the choice
of an individual’s aspired goal. Generally the two popular
measures used in aspirational studies are :

a. Goal Discrepancy (G.D) = Present Aspiration —
Previous Attainment ;
_b. Attainment Discrepancy (AD) = Present Attainment —
_ Previous Aspiration

For normal persons G.D. will be slightly positive and
A.D. will be slightly negative.

3:07 Two Types of Motivation

There are two types of Motivation. They are: (i)
Extrinsic Motivation and (ii) Intrinsic Motivation

3:07:17 Extrinsic Motives

in another classification of motives, they are divided
into Intrinsic’ and ‘Extrinsic’ motives. Psychologically
all motivation is intrinsic. By extrinsic motivation we refer
to certain incentives or reinforcements. inat are external.
The extrinsic incentives may consist of money or.a toy or
sweet. When a child is assigned a task and told that he
would get Rs. 10/- on completing it within a specified time,
the child putsforth his best efforts to finish the task in
- time. This is a case of extrinsic motivation.



============================================================
--- Page 60 ---
============================================================

104 Educational Psychology

3:07:2
Intrinsic motivation is inherent in the activity itself. In
extrinsic motivation the task is undertaken because it is
rewarding. The task leads to goal. But in intrinsic
motivation, itis not a means to an end. It is an end in
itself. The task is not undertaken for something else but
preforming it jiself is satisfying. Children find intrinsic
motivation in play. Adults are intrinsically motivated to
hear music, go to temples and offer prayer etc. If we play
for a trophy or prize money, then it is external motivation;
but if we play for the sake of the satisfaction we derive
from it, then it is a case of intrinsic motivation.
3:07:3 Merits and Limitations of Extrinsic
and Intrinsic Motives

Intrinsic Motives

Reward and punishment, success or failure, use of
audio-visual aids, cooperation and competition are all
cases of extrinsic motivation. But when we emphasize
rewards and punishment (or.success and failure) too

much it may lead to a negative attitude towards the school
; by the student. This is the limitation of extrinsic motivation.
But when students develop a positive attitude, then it
develops an involvement of ego towards the task. They
become intrinsically attached to the task. This Is
permanent and this is a case of intrinsic motivation.

stages of teaching. Following are certain common
techniques used by teachers to motivate the students :

Rewards in the form of prizes, distinctions, graces,
decorations etc. generate interest and enthusiasm in
pupils and appeal to Ego involvement and Ego-
maximisation.

i. Use of proper incentives as motivating agents,
appropriate to’ the age group of students. [(eg.) In
Primary classes, rewards and prizes may operate
effectively; in high school classes praise and blames
will be more suitable than rewards} my

2. Students should be helped to feel the utility of what
they learn by relating them io practical life situations.

3. Provide feedback to students ‘about their
performance, then and there; announce test results
in the class, possibly the next day itself. This makes
the learner motivated to learn and face the next
test eagerly. Similarly teacher’s nod of head, smile,
verbal appreciation etc. will serve as feedback in
the actual classroom teaching-learning situation,
when students present their responses.

4. Goal setting : Motivational behaviour is always goal
~ oriented. When the goal is clear and attainable,
the students strive hard to reach the goal.

5. Ensuring success to all, at least to some extent :
Graded assignments should be given such that
every one will have some success initially and
continue their efforts but the talented may claim
more success or full success. ;

6. Competition and Co-operation : Teachers should

stress cooperation as a motive in study and sporis.
Where competitions are used, it should be set

among the groups with frequent changing of group
members. Within each group, individual members -

should be goaded for self-competition.

Professional competency and sensitivity to the
needs of pupils help the teacher in his task and
kindle students’ interest in their learning. The
imaginative use of Audio-visual Instructional Aids
ig of great value in making the classroom teaching
interesting.

8. Avoid excessive motivation as it is self-defeating.

Develop positive attitude in pupils towards the
school. situation and towards learning itself and
proper teacher-pupil relationship is basic to such
an attitude.

Besides the strategies discussed above, some

modern dynamic methods of instruction like team
teaching, group discussion, brain storming, quiz
programmes, etc. will keep the tempo of the class. Any
teacher can become a motivating teacher if he adheres
to the following : ;

a.
b.
Cc.

increased participation of the learners.

Warmth and enthusiasm of the teacher in
appreciation of students’ efforts.

Setting clear-cut goals, within the reach of the
pupils.

Motivation and Learning: 107

&.

Good rapport with the students inside and outside
the class

Like a stage actor, the teacher should. keep the
tempo in the class by resorting to proper modulation
of voice, gestures, etc. using varied techniques like
demonstration, illustration (visual and verbal), etc.

Continuous internal assessment provides for
continued motivation, eliminating needless tension
in the last minute.

3:09 Meaning and Definition of ‘Learning’

The knowledge we acquire, the language we speak,

_ the habits, attitudes and skills developed in us are all
due to learning

Psychologists define learning as “a relatively

permanent change in behaviour, which occurs as a
result of activity, training, practice or experience” This

detinition of learning has three important elements:

2)

1) Learning results in change in behaviour.

it isa change that takes place through practice or
experience. (Changes due to growth and: maturation
are relatively indegendent of activity, practice or
experience and hence they are not learning).

Before it can be called learning, the change must
be relatively permanent. It must last a fairly long
time. But behaviour changes brought about by
fatigue, drugs, illness, warm up, etc. are transitory
in nature and hence they are not included under
learning.

nnn

Thus learning could be defined more simply as

“profiting from experience”.
3:10 Nature of Learning

The following are the important characteristics of

learning:

1.
2.

Learning is universal. All living beings learn.

Learning is continuous; itis a perpetual activity that
takes place from ‘womb to tomb’.

3. Learning results in improved performance.

4, Learning is purposive :Achild’s learning in and out

of school is closely linked up with its goals, purposes:
and satisfactions. Nobody learns anything without
a purpose.

Learning is multiple and integrative. For purposes
of research, psychologists often try to distinguish
different kinds of learning such as verbal learning,
perceptual learning, motor learning, conceptual
learning, problem-solving and emotional learning;
but these distinctions, though useful, are artificial.
For example, a girl who learns shorthand does not
learn a motor skill only. She also learns many
arbitrary relationships between short visual symbols
and how to make and apply the symbols (verbal,
motor and associative learning). At the same time,

_ she certainly learns some attitudes about shorthand,

the commercial world and. herself (emotional
learning).

. Learning is contingent upon experience.

Motivation and Learning

Hence ‘Learning’ is not something to be given; itis

to be gained by self-experience. A person's knowledge
or learning is the result of that person's experience.

31 Factors Influencing Learning

The following factors have been found to exert

influence in one's learning:
4:

Motivation : McConnell states that a driving force
is necessary for an individual to learn. Psychologists
like Gates point out that motives are largely
responsible for one’s normal behaviour as weil as
changes noticed in them. Thus we may concludethat
motivation is a major factor in one's learning.

Needs : Environmental needs stimulate an individual
to learn. As needs multiply, amount of learning also
increases.

Maturation is important for one to learn. Maturation

provides the necessary learning readiness in
individuals.

Feedback received while learning helps to accelarate

and consolidate one's learning.

The level of intelligence of a person, determines
his learning method, rate of learning, nature and
amount of the material learnt. :

Attention is a pre-requisite for learning. A warm,
pleasant atmosphere is highly helpful in learning.
Getting success initially as one starts learning induces
further learning.

eevee eit mer MET et

theories of learning arose out of the Gestalt point of view
according to which human experiences have certain
“field properties” that make a ‘total’ or ‘whoie’
phenomenon greater than the sum of its individual parts.
Field is the total psychological world in which an individual
operates at a given moment. An individual reacts not io
the environment as it is but as he perceives it at the
moment of behaviour. What is important in learning is
not the awareness of isolated elements but the meaning,
the situation has for the individual. Relation among
elements is more important than the elements
thernselves. Learning “involves structuring the
cognitive field and formulating cognitive patterns
corresponding to the relation among stimuli in the
environment”. Due to learning, our experiences are
reorganised so as to make them systematic and
meaningful patterns. Learning is not building simple
perceptions inte complex patterns, but one of proceeding
from ‘a complex unit that is partially understood to a
gradual clarification’. Field theories emphasize
organisation, relationship, meaningfulness, insight
and cognitive clarity.

The major differences between Association and Field
theories are listed as follows:

3:13 Thorndike’s Connectionism

Thorndike’s Connectionism also referred to as
‘trial and error learning’ is based on experiments
conducted by him. Thorndike spoke of learning as a trial
and error process developing neural connections betweon
stimuli and responses. When a stimulus is presented,
the organism picks a response and connects ‘it; by
repeated trials the organism eliminates the errors
gradually and selects the appropriate response for the
stimulus and connects it. Learning-is a matter of
accidental hitting of correct response which is ‘stamped
in’ as a result of satisfaction. A irial is defined by the
length of time (or of number of errors committed) in a

single reaching of the goal.



============================================================
--- Page 66 ---
============================================================

116 Educational Psychology
A

Animals mostly use trial and error learning. Human
beings too resort to it to learn complex and abstract tasks
as weil as tasks involving motor skills. According to
Thorndike, the law of effect is the basic principle of
learning.

3:13:1 Characteristics of Trial and Error
Learning

There are four characteristic features of trial and
error learning.

i. There is some sort of motive that arouses and
sustains the activity. This motive appears in the
form of a need, a problem or goal. This impels one
to activity
The organism makes several different kinds of
responses to the situation Le. varied responses.

iii. There is a progressive elimination of the irrelevant,
unsuccessful forms of activity:

iv. Finally, there is progressive integration and
establishment of the response by which the goal is
achieved.

3:13:2 Thorndike’s Puzzle Box Experiment

He placed a hungry cat in the puzzle box. A piece of /

fish in a dish was kept outside the box. The box could be
opened by correctly manipulating a latch. On seeing th
fish, the cat became restless and made frantic effort
such as biting, clawing, and dashing the wails before th

latch moved accidently and the door opened. On-

subsequent trials such incorrect responses i.e. biting

Motivation and Learning T17

clawing and dashing are gradually stamped out and the
cat took less time on them. After a few triais the cat was
found to have eliminated all the wasteful movements
(errors) and it operated the mechanism (latch) with
considerable ease in the first attempt itself. This
experiment shows that learning is simply selecting and
connecting the correct response with the given stimulus
by a process of progressive reduction of incorrect
responses and stamping in the correct response through
trial-and-error. If the trials were continued even after
iearning to do the task correctly, efficiency of performance
of the cat increased (time taken to finish the task correctly,
decreased) and reached the maximum level, after which
there was not much gain in efficiency.

3:13:3 Thorndike’s Laws of Learning

Based on the findings obtained in his puzzle box
experiment, Thorndike enunciated three primary laws of
learning viz. Law of readiness, law of exercise and law
of effect.

1. Law of readiness : “When any conducting unit
is ready to conduct, to allow it to. do so is
satisfying, not to allow it to do so is annoying.
When any conducting unit is not ready to
conduct, for it*to conduct is annoying”.
Thorndike’s law of readiness is a law of preparatory
adjustment and not a jaw about growth.

Educational implications : a) The teacher shouid
see that the child is motivated to learn before he
begins to teach. Motivation is the royal road to


============================================================
--- Page 67 ---
============================================================

118

Educational Psychology

ep nnnronrencerninrsienparnnnciininnaneenmnnatemmctttaases tna merce

learning. Preparatory exercises that will hasten the
state of readiness can be given. The teacher should
introduce a lesson by relating it to the background
experience of the child.

Interest inventories and aptitude tests can also be
administered to know the entry behaviour of the
learners, especially in admitting students for
specialised courses.

Law of exercise “When a modifiable
connection is made between a stimulus and
response, other things being equal, that
connection’s strength increases if it is repeated
a number of times”. This is called the Saw of
frequency’. This is akin to what we mean when we
say practice makes perfect.

Another principle governing trial and error is that an

act which has just recently been performed has an

’ advantage of being repeated once again, for the simple
reason that it is fresh in the experience of the organism.
This principle is called ‘law of recency’.

These two laws of frequency and of recency are

grouped together under the name of law of exercise.

Educational implications : a) After learning
anything, adequate practice or drill should be
undertaken to ensure that learning becomes stable
and effective.

b) Periodical review of learned material is
necessary.

3)

c) Mere drill or exercise is not enough; continuous
feedback is also necessary. ;

d) Bad habits can be eliminated through disuse,
leading to atrophy or forgetting.

Law of effect : ‘it refers to the strengthening or
weakening of a connection as a result of its
consequences. The law states, “when a modifiable
connection is made between a stimulus and a
response and is followed up by satisfying state
of affairs, its strength increases; when followed
by dissatisfying state of affairs, its strength
decreases”. ;

As “success leads to further success”, school
activities can be arranged in such a way that all
learners may have some degree of success and
confidence in their work i.e. ail assignments should
be so graded that everyone geis some success
initially.

3: 13:4 Limitations of Throndike’s Theory of

Learning

The following are the important limitations of

Thorndike’s theory of learning:

motor learning and that too for learning a complex

ence
task in an unfamiliar situation. All human learning
does not take place at the physical level alone.

2. Thorndikian theory reduces intelligence to the
capacity to form S-R bonds, i.e. learning becomes
mechanical and the cognitive skills like thinking,
reasoning, comprehending, imagining, etc. have no
relevance in learning. This may be true in animal
learning. Human beings are unique for their
intelligence and the use of their sharpened cognitive
capacities.

3. According to Thorndike, what fixes the correct
patiern of activity is recency, frequency and effect
of the elements that through association go to make
up the pattern of activity. But this is not true in the
case of complex high order learning. A complex
algebraic problem cannot be solved by repeatedly
doing the problem, without proper understanding.

3:14 Classical Conditioning

in 1904, Russian physiologist lan Pavlov, during his
experimental work on dog’s digestive process,
accidentally noticed the secretion of saliva in the dog on
the sight of food or hearing the footsteps of the caretaker.
Conditioning can be defined as “a process in which a
neutral stimulus which is not associated with any
specific natural response, on pairing with a natural
stimulus, acquires all the characteristics of natural
stimulus”. For example, if food is presented, saliva flows.
Food is the ‘natural stimulus’ (or unconditioned
stimulus-U.C.S.) that can elicit the ‘natural response’
(or unconditioned response-U.C.R.) ‘salivating’. The

Motivation and Learning 121

sound of a bell which is a neutral stimulus, not associated
with any specific response originally, when paired with
food a number of times, acquires the characteristics of
food and starts eliciting the response of salivation, even
when presented alone. Now we say the dog has been
conditioned to the sound of bell and we refer. the bell
sound as ‘conditioned stimulus’ (C.S.) and ‘salivation’
as ‘conditioned response’ (C.R.). The classical
conditioning’ of Paviov is also called ‘stimujus
substitution’ because we substitute a neutral stimulus,
through the process of ‘contiguity’ (occurrence of two
events in quick succession). ™

3:14:1 Paviov's Experiment

When we put food in the mouth of the dog, the dog
salivates. This response,.on the part of the dog, is natural
and unfailing. Food is called as the unconditioned
stimulus (UCS) and the salivation by the dog is called
unconditioned response (UCR). Food is called UCS and
salivation is called UCR because the response depends
upon no special condition and it is unlearned and implies
no pre-conditions. During his experimentation on dogs,
he presented food, a few seconds after ringing a bell. At
first the dog did not exhibit any specific response on
hearing the ringing bell. Sometimes it may turn round
towards the direction of sound, raise its ears, or indulge
in barking etc. but not salivate. But when it started taking
food, it salivated. This showed that the bell sound is a
neutral stimulus, as it is not capable of eliciting any
specific response. This is the first stage of the experiment.


============================================================
--- Page 69 ---
============================================================

122 Educational Psychology
nett

When the experiment of pairing the bell sound
(neuiral stimulus) with the presentation of food (natural
stimulus) for about 15 days continuously, it was noticed
that the dog started salivating even on hearing the bell
sound, well ahead of seeing the food. Now the bell sound
has acquired the capability of eliciting a specific response
(salivating) for it. Now it is said the dog has been
conditioned to the ‘ringing bell’. This phenomenon of
making a neutral stimulus to elicit a specific response,
by continuously pairing it with a natural stimulus is termed
as ‘conditioning’. ;

Symbolic representation of classical conditioning is
given below :

Motivation and Learning ; 123

by UCS (food), for few days, it means there is no
reinforcement. A stage comes when the dog stops to
secrete saliva. This process is known as extinction.

The classic example for conditioning is
Thenaliraman's cat, which on burning its mouth by lipsing
hot milk, started running away from white liquids after
that incident. It is also quite common to notice that people
bring down wild pigeons usually sitting on high towers by
employing domesticated and trained pigeons.

Conditioning appears to be. the simplest type of
learning and the basis for further and more complex lypes
of learning. Most of the animal learnings could be
explained through the concept of conditioning.
Conditioning appears to be an imporiant means of
learning among human beings too, particularly in
childhood. Simple patterns of behaviour, learning of words
and their associated meanings, new emotional responses
may all be satisfactorily explained using the concept of
conditioning.

3:14:2 Educational implications of
Conditioning Theory of Learning
1. Classical conditioning is used in language learning
by associating worgls with pictures or meanings.
2. It can be used to develop favourable attitude
towards learning, teachers, subjects and the school.
3. Developing good habits in children such as

cleanliness, respect for elders, punctuality, etc.
through the use of conditioning.

4. Breaking of bad habits and elimination of

3:14:3 Limitations of Conditioning Theory of
Learning

Complex areas of learning, involving generalisation,
abstraction, reasoning, understanding and problem-
solving cannot be explained by conditioning process. It can
describe only those learnings related to emotional shaping
and habit formation. ;

3:14:4 Laws of Conditioning

From his experiments of conditioning, Pavlov derived
the following five laws :

i. Law of Causation : According to this law, a

conditioned response is established by a series of
contiguous pairings of CS and UCS. That is, when the
UCS. and CS are presented in temporal contiguity
(associated in time), a conditioned response gets
established.

(Simultaneous
conditioning)

Zi

THelayed
conditioning)

(Trace —— (Backward
conditioning) conditioning)
(Temporal relationships in conditioning}

Motivation and Learning 425

Best conditioning occurs when the CS and UCS are
presented simultaneously or CS is the signal heralding
the occurance of UCS.

2. Law of Experimental Extinction : if ihe CR is
elicited without reinforcement by the presentation of the
UCS, then the CR gets weakened and finally disappears.
Suppose the salivation is conditioned by ringing the bell,
without presenting the reinforcing agent viz., food (UCS),
after a few trials, the response (the amount of saliva)
graduaily reduces and finally the response may noj occur
at all. The dog probably thinks that it cannot be fooled
any further. However this disappearance of the CR is not
permanent. When the dog is again brought from rest it
once again salivates on hearing the bell. This immediate
recovery of conditioned response is called ‘Spontaneous
recovery’.

3. Law of Generalisation : Once the C.R. is
established, it may be elicited by any stimulus similar to
the original CS. lf conditioning was established using bell
as the CS, the C.R. will occur even for a buzzer. If fear
response is obtained for a policeman, it may be obtained
for anybody in kaki uniform.

4. Law of Discrimination (or selective
conditioning) : A selective CR can be established by
selective reinforcement. Suppose a CR is established to
a bell sound the same generalisation is shown to a buzzer
sound also. If the CR that follows the bell sound is
reinforced by presenting the UCS, and the CR that follows


============================================================
--- Page 71 ---
============================================================

125 Educational Psychology

the buzzer sound is not reinforced, then the CR to the
buzzer sound gets weakened and becomes inactive.

5. Law of Higher order Conditioning : The pairing
of a neutral stimulus with a UCS results not only in its
becoming a conditioned stimulus for the response but
also in its becoming a reinforcing stimulus in its own right.
Thus what was formally a CS (say bell sound) can be
used in a second pairing phase to conditioning another
neutral stimulus (say light). Pavlov called this
phenomenon second order or higher order conditioning.
Second order conditioning is weak as compared io first
order or primary conditioning.

3:15 Concept of ‘Reinforcement’

Any stimulus is’ a reinforcer if it increases the
probability of occurance of a particular desired response.
For example, in Paviov’s experiment, food was presented
immediately after the dog heard the bell sound and started
salivating. Here to increase the occurance of the
conditioned response viz. salivating on hearing the bell
sound, food was presented as a reinforcer.

Thus ‘reinforcement’ could be defined as the
phenomenon in which a desired response when
emitted is strengthened by presenting a reinforcer
and thereby increasing the frequency of occurance
of that particular response.

3:16 Positive and Negative Reinforcers

A positive reinforcer is any stimulus, which when
applied following an operate response, strengthens the

Motivation and Learning 127

probability of occurance of that response (eg. Food, water
or any other reward). Due to our social learning, prize,
praise, money, social recognition etc. also serve as
positive reinforcers.

A negative reinforcer is any stimulus which, when

_ removed following an operant response, strengthens

the probability of occurrence of that response (eg.
Loud noise, bright light, extreme heat or cold, electric
shock, etc. ). Reward-training procedures use positive
reinforcers. Escape or avoidance training uses negative
reinforcers.

Punishment is not a negative reinforcer as it
involves the presentation of an aversive stimulus to
decrease the probability of occurance of a response. But
the termination or withdrawal of such painful stimuli
constitutes negative reinicrcement which increase the
probability of occurance of a desired response. Though
negative reinforcers and punishment are made of
aversive stimuli, they difter in their purpose and method
of operation as depicted in the following page.

3:17 Skinner's Operant Conditioning

8.F. Skinner believed that no stimulus is capable of
eliciting a unique response from an organism. It is the
organism which emits ail kinds of responses
spontaneously. For example, a cat without any reason
licks its face with its tongue, a dog barks, a pigeon pecks
ai dots. All such responses are emitted responses.


============================================================
--- Page 72 ---
============================================================

128 Educational Psychology
nnn a
Whenever an organism emits a desired response, it could
be made to occur frequently by suitably rewarding it by
presenting 2 reinforcing stimulus. Thus reinforcement
of desired response is the essence of operant
conditioning whereas in classical conditioning, stimulus
substitution takes place by pairing the neutral stimulus
with a natural stimulus or UCS. Operant conditioning is
called type-R conditioning in contrast to classical
conditioning in which there is type-S (stimulus)
conditioning. An important point in operant conditioning is
that the reinforcer must come after the desired response
has been made and not before it.

Here to get the reward or praise, the organism has
to operate in (or to deal with) its environment ina
particular way. So this type of learning is also termed as
“operant conditioning”. As the organism expresses &
response or behaviour pattern and through that tries to
fetch the reward, this type of learning is also known as
“Instrumental conditioning”.

3:17:1 Skinner’s Experiments

Skinner’s box is a cage in which a white hungry rat
is placed. A simple response of pressing a lever was
chosen as a unit of desired behaviour. The movements
of the rat were electrically recorded and cumulative record
of the behaviour of the rat was obtained. The rat by
chance pushed the bar and got a pullet of food. After
eating that pullet of food, it repeatedly pressed the bar

Motivation and Learning 129

and every time got food pullets. Food reinforced the bar-
pressing response and soon the rat became conditioned
to that response. Reinforcement is central to operant
conditioning. In another experiment conducted on pigeon, .
the pigeon moves about the cage. It was trained to peck
a disk. Every time when it pecked, food was supplied.
Thus food reinforced the behaviour of pecking the disk,
called an operant. The law of operant conditioning states
that if the occurance of an operant is followed by the
presentation of a reinforcing stimulus, the strength of
operant is increased. If the response (operant) is not
reinforced, it results in the extinction of the response.
Extinction of a response means its becoming less and
less frequent. ;

3:17:2 Educational Implications of Skinner’s
Theory

Skinner’s operant conditioning theory has found
application in education in the following ways :

1.  individualisation of instruction : Programmed
learning, teaching machines, computer-assisted
instruction, etc. have their basis in Skinner’s
theory of reinforcement of selective response.
2. Behaviour modification techniques :

- Use of instructional objectives;

- Performance contracting;

- Learning for mastery;

- Teacher Effectiveness Training (T.E.T.).

3:19 Differences Between ‘Reinforcement’
and ‘Feedback’

Reinforcement refers to the strengthening the

probability of occurrence of a desired response either by

presenting the organism after the operant response is
exhibited, with a positive reinforcer or withdrawal of a
negative reinforcer. Positive reinforcers may be any
rewards like food, toys, money, etc.

Feedback refers to the knowledge of results of one’s
own actions. It has been demonstrated thai in the case
of grown up adults, knowledge of results of one’s own
action itseif serves as a positive reinforcer and enhance

the level of performance. Thus ‘feedback’ is one of the

means of achieving reinforcement of desired respones.

Though both rewards and feedback serve as means
of reinforcement, the former operates at the physical level
and the latter at the psychological level. Reinforcement
by rewards is highly suitable for children and animals while
feedback proves to be more effective and satisfying as a
reinforcer for matured adults.

3:20 Jean Piaget’ s Theory of Cognitive
Development

Cognitive developm@gnt arises as a result of the
interaction between the individual and the world and
passes through a series of sequential stages. People have
cognitive structures called Schemata for processing
information and these structures undergo significant
transformations during devsiopment, thus. becoming
qualitatively different at different stages. These are
sequential, invariant and universai.

Stages of Cognitive Development

According to Plaget to "know an object one must
act upon it either physically or mentally" and these
activities that people perform on objects are called
‘Schemas’. In the early developmental stages, the
schemas are mostly physical actions on the objects of
the immediate environment; but as the child grows into
adolescence, these physical actions, become mental
operations. Each developmental stage has its particular
schemas (of organising and adapting to the environment)
from sensory motor actions to concrete and later formal
operations. On the basis of the schemas constituting
cognitive structure, Piaget speaks of 4 important stages
of cognitive development:

1) Sensory-Motor Stage (0 to 2 years)

2) Pre-operational Stage (2 to 7 years) _

3) Concrete Operational Stage (7 to 11 years)

4) Formal Operational Stage (11 years and above)

3:20:1 Sensory - Motor Stage

This stage is mainly based on immediate experience _
‘through the ‘senses’ and the major intellectual activity is
the sensory interaction of the environment. The child's .
activities are physical and without language, to label |

experiences. This stage is characterised by :

i) Development of sensory, motor and perceptual :

skills.
ii) Coordination of motor activities.

Motivation and Learning 133

(For example if a smal! colured ball is presented to 4
six month old infant, it tries to hold it by using all its four
limbs (as it does not know that hands and legs can be
moved separately); but an eight month old infant will try
to hold the ball only with hands; a ten month old infant
tries to- hold a small object like a iemon by a single hand
and use both hands for objects of big size).

iii) At first, fora child an object ‘out of sight’ is ‘out of
mind’. But towards the close of the second year it
learns ‘object permanence’ in space and time.

(For example, to a young child of 6 or 7 monthsrif a
toy, which he is trying to reach, is covered by a cloth
thereby hiding it, his attempts to reach it stop immediately.
But a 18 months old child continues to search for it,
thereby indicating that he knows that the object exists
though it is not present to his sense).

iv) development of rudimentary memory;

v) gradual progression from reflex behaviour to
intentional behaviour;

vi) development of curiosity, and trial and error
exploration of immediate surroundings;

vii) able to differentiaté itself from objects and this is
the basis of self-concept.

In short, we can say during sensory motor stage the
child develops practical intelligence like seeing, grasping,
sucking, etc. to deal with objects in the environment and
cannot use symbolic operations.

3:20:2 Pre-operational Stage

The thinking of pre-operational child is characterised
by:

i) ego-centrism : (use of words which have unique
meaning for the child, which limits the child's ability
to understand others’ point of view);

ii) animism : (treating inanimate objects as living
ones; e.g. children bathing, dressing and feeding
their dolls as if they are alive)

iii) realism : (dreams are considered real) (e.g.
children at this stage pretend stuffed toys are real,
have imaginary friends etc.)

iv) Centering : (the child can concentrate on only one
aspect of a thing at a time).

v) Due to centering they can not understand that
objects are conserved even if they change their
positions or their shapes altered.

‘[(e-g.)

The child may accept that the identical jars A and B
contain equal amount of water. However on transferring
the entire amount of water from B to a wide mouthed jar
C without spill or spiash, the child will assert that A
contains more amount of water as compared to C. The
child considers the height of water column alone without

Motivation and Learning 135

taking into account the breadth of the jar. On transferring
water from C to B back, again the child will say A and B
are equal].

vi) cannot understand reversibility (e.g. what is at your
back? The child answers ‘dog’. Who is in front of
the dog? The child says ‘nobody’. Irreversibility and
ego-centricism are related.

vil) Consider their parents as omnipresent and
omnipotent.

viii) inability to play any game, following the rules.
3:20:3 Concrete Operational Stage»

During this stage, the child masters various
conservation concepts and begins to perform logical
manipulations. Classification and seriation (organising
objects into ordered series as increasing size, etc.)
become possible at this stage. Hée-can also form a mental
representation of a series of acts. But this is only at
concrete level. i.e: hé-can represent things menially only
those objects which are perceivable in the real world.
Beyond their self experiences they cannot think.

[(e-g.) If a child of 5 or 6 years is asked how to go to
his aunt's house nearby, he may not be able to explain
the route; but he will be able to lead us fo.his aunt's
house]. _

Other hallmarks of this stage are :

a) transversibility is known; i.e. If A=2B and A=2C, then
they can understand B=C.

b) understand ‘decentering’ (think of more than one
quality at a time);



============================================================

c) can play any game according to rule;

d) evaluate crime in terms of magnitude and not in
terms of motive. ;

@) think that their point of view alone is possible and
real and do not believe that there could be other
points of view.

f) their thinking is very rigid; do not understand

relativistic ideas. [(e.g.) they believe that morality.

will be the same in ail cultures, at all places, for all
the times].

3:20:4 Stages of Formal Operational Stage

1) During this stage thought becomes increasingly
flexible and abstract. He can carry out systematic
experiments and keep a record of the track of what has
been done, consider hypothetical obiects and events,
understand abstract ideas and principles. Theorising and
critical evaiuation as well as "pitting the pessible
against the real” are evident ai this stage.

[Attempts to solve the chemical probiem illustrates

to the mixed chemicals, make it yellow in colour. To this
when few drops of a third chemical liquid (from among
the remaining two of the four beakers) are added, the
yellow colour becomes green. Children are asked to
reproduce the colours in the same sequential order.

[Two of the four (A,B,C,D) taken]

lt was found that children below 2 years ignored the
problem and played with their toys. Children belonging
to the pre-operational period start combining the liquids
but they do not maintain a systematic track of what they
are doing. Concrete operational children try some
combinations of liquids but they get confused after
sometime and lose interest

2) Children at the formal stage are able to tackle
any problem in a lagical sequence. Like scientists they

— work at it systematically and maintain record and

ultimately find the solution .

[In the ilustration given above, the solution is arrived
at as follows:

Step |. Write down the different possibilities of

3) Formal operational children exhibit the following
characteristics also :

i) Start evaluating acis in terms of underlying motives.
ii) Understand that the rules of any games or social

system are developed by man by mutual agreement
and hence could be changed or modified.

iii) Start believing that there could be many points of
view on any problem, even though he may not be
knowing all.

Motivation and Learning 189

_ iv) Understand that nothing is absolute; everything is

relative and hence search for the better alternative
should be continuously tried to evolve the ideal one.

3:21 Educational implications of Piaget's
Theory

1) 'True learning’ as discriminated from ‘verbal
learning’ involves the acquisition of new structures
of mental operations that permit the child to
assimilate new experiments. Hence experiential
curriculum is advocated.

2) Emphasis on discovery approach in learning. *

3) Curriculum should provide specific educational
experience based on children’s developmental level.

4) Arrange classroom activities so that they assist and
encourage self-learning.

5) Do not treat children as miniature adults; they think
and learn differently from adulis. ,

6) Co-curricular activities have equal importance as
that of curricular experiences in the cognitive
development of children.

7) Fruitless pushing beyond a child's cognitive stage
as well as neediéss delays should. be avoided.
Sufficient time should be provided to.the child to
internalise the experiences.

8) Moral and intellectual growth go together and only
after the age of 11, can the child evaluate actions
in the light of motives.

3:22 John Deweys Theory of Constructivism

3:22:1 Meaning of Knowledge Construction /
Constructivism

A person on getting new information from the
environment, process it in the light of his already existing
knowledge or cognitive structure (this gets continuously
developed and modified, based on one’s personal
experiences), and makes sense out of it and finally
registers it in the mind as subjective representa-tion. This
process of assimilation and integration of new information
with one’s own already existing knowledge is called
learning or knowledge construction i.e. learning is the
process of learner making the information he receives
meaningful and registering it in his memory. In other
words, learning is nothing but the process of constructing
knowledge. That is, learning is not just copying
information that are received from outside world either
through seeing, hearing or reading and registering them
in memory. (It is not constructing knowledge). On the
other hand, making the information thus received as
meaningful and assimilating them is, ‘constructing
knowledge’ or learning.

Motivation and Learning 141

in this approach, learners. examine the information
received by them in the light of their experiences, makes
them meaningful and register them in the mind as
subjective representations. in learner undertaking this
kind of process, the teacher plays the role of a cogni-
tive guide i.e. to help students to meaningfully interact
with what they learn, the teacher provides suitable
educational and social environment. Teacher helps
students in their learning activities such as under-standing
new information or experiences and selecting the most
suitable ones among them, organizing and integ?ating
them with the knowledge they already have.

The classroom environment most conducive for
knowledge construction, facilitates students to question,
challenge and formulate their own ideas, opinions and
conclusions. Learning activities in constructivist settings
are characterized by active engagement, inquiry,
problem-solving and collaboration with others. The
teacher will not be a dispenser of knowledge but will
actasa guide, facilitator and co-expiorer. The correct
answer and single interpretation are de-emphasized.

3:22:2 Nature of Constructivist Learning

According to the constructivist theory, construction
of knowledge takes place in short term memory. (This is
also known as working memory of the learners). In this
process, the learner uses the new information obtained
from his environment and the knowledge already stored

in his long term memory i.e. to meaningfully interpret the
new information received; he selects the appropriate ones
from the knowledge in store of his memory and compares
with them. Then he organizes the new information and
integrates them with his knowledge pool.

3:29:3 Role and Functions of Teacher in the
Constructivist Classroom

in a constructivist classroom environment where
teacher encourages students’ initiatives and gives
freedom for inquiry, his role and functions will be as
follows:

i) Teacher frequently asks open-ended questions in
the classroom and patiently waits for students to
answer. ; ;

ii) Teacher gives much importance to students’ higher
order thinking and logical reasoning.

iii) Provides ample opportunities to students to interact
among themselves and also with him.

iv) He encourages students to share their experiences
among themselves.

v) He emphasizes inquiry-based learning.

vi) He gives more importance to problem-solving
approach in learning.

vil) He more often makes use of teaching techniques
like ‘group interacting sessions’, ‘cooperative
learning’, ‘collaborative iearning’, ‘group project
work’, ‘solving jigsaw puzzles’ etc. in his classroom
teaching.

ii) Setting the learning tasks for the lessons

iv) Evaluating the process and product of group work

The role of the teacher in these four phases is
highlighted as follews:

3:22:3:01 Making Decisions Before the
Lesson Begins

Teacher should decide upon the academic and social
objectives to be realized by students as a result of
learning, before they start cooperative learning of a
particular lesson. Academic objectives refer to the content
knowledge and skills to be acquired with respect to a
lesson. Social! objectives refer to social interaction skills
to be acquired by the students.

$:22:3:02 Setting the Learning Tasks for the
, Lesson :

’ The teacher should explain to the student-groups
about the learning tasks to be completed. Teacher should
make sure whether the students have understood what
he explained. Teacher sould emphasize that apart from
achieving academic objectives of the lesson, students
should develop social skills too.

teacher may give suggestions/assistance io those groups
which are found to be lagging behind in the learning
progress and stimulate them to accomplish the assigned
task.
-3:29:3:04 Evaluating the Product and
Process of Group work

Teacher should provide opportunities to every group
to assess the academic achievement of its own group
members as well as that of the other groups. While
evaluating the accomplishment of students, it should be
kept in mind that accomplishment includes achievement
of the objectives of the lesson in full and development of
social skills.
3:23 Humanistic Psychology and its

Basic Premises

During the 1950s, humanistic psychology began as
a reaction to 'psycho-analysis’, and ‘behaviourism’, which
dominated psychology at that time. Psycho-analysis was
focussed on understanding the unconscious motivation

that drive behaviour while pehaviourism studied the
conditioning processes that produce behaviour. Humanist
thinkers felt that both psycho-analysis and behaviourism
were too pessimistic, either focussing on the most tragic
emotions or failing to take into account the role of personal

choice. :

Humanistic psychology was instead focussed on
each individual's potential and siressed the importance

~~ Motivation and Learning 147

of growth and self-actualization. The fundamental belief
of humanistic psychology is that people are innately good
and that mental and social problems result from deviations

_ from this natural tendency. Humanistic psychologists look

at human behaviour not only through the eyes of the

_ observer, but through the eyes of the person exhibiting
- the behaviour. Humanistic psychologists believe that an

individual's behaviour is connected to his inner feelings,
self image, and self-confidence. By enlightening an

ndividual to correctly understand himself and his

nvironment, his behaviour could be corrected. on

Putting it in short, we can say that humanistic

psychologists are not primarily concerned with instinctual

drives, responses to external stimuli, or past experiences.
Rather they consider conscious choices, responses to
nternal needs and current circumstances to be important
n shaping human behaviour.

Abraham Masiow, Carl Rogers, Rollo May, Eric
Fromm, Gordon Allport are the erninent contributors to
he growth of Humanistic Psychology. ,

3:24 Humanistic Psychologists’ View of
‘Learning’

Humanistic psychologists define ‘iearning’ as a
function of the whole person using his potential abilities
ully and further, learning cannot take place without
nvolving cognitive and affective domains.

According to humanistic psychologists, learning is
lostered by structuring well the information: presented,


============================================================
--- Page 82 ---
============================================================

148 Educational Psychology

providing for conscious choices and control of one’s own
actions, linking learning materials with the present needs
of the learner and involving the learner mentally and
emotionally in the learning activities. Now, we shall look
into them in detail.

1. Conscious Choices and Control of Actions:

Humanistic psychologists give great importance to
choice given for the learner to select the subjects of
study and learning activities. From the day to day activities
of the students to planning and setting their future goals
from time to time, students should be encouraged to
function according to their own choices. This makes the
studenis to learn with interest the subjects they selected
and that too with more attention, spending 2 lot of time.

it is necessary forthe teachers to motivate students and
get engaged in the materials they are learning. If the
learning materials are related to the students’ needs and
interests, even without any external motivation, students

will themselves get involved in learning.

2. Felt Needs:

Humanistic education pays more attention to
and cognitive ability.
Students’ overall mental dispositions and feelings can _

students’ felt needs, interests

either foster or hinder their learning. In other words, thei

current circumstances are capable of affecting their.

learning significantly.
3. Development of the Whole Person:

Humanistic educators believe that learning should
improve both knowledge and feelings of students. Unlike.

Motivation and Learning 149

traditional educators, humanistic educators do not

consider cognitive and affective domains as separate.

The humanists stress that this important aspect should

get reflected in the curriculum. They point out that the

lessons and activities in the curriculum should not only

emphasize knowledge development but also give

importance to the emotional development of students. .
The aim of the teaching-learning process should be the

development of whole personality of the learners.

3:25 Carl Roger’s Theory of Fully Functioning
Person

Carl Rogers considers that every individual has the
_ potential to fulfill his life-goals and ambitions. Only those
who use their potential fully and realize their. life-goals
~ are self-actualized persons (Rogers, 1961). Only those
who, acting without any compulsion or pressure viz. acting
on their own volition and personal choice use their
potential fully and progress towards life goal and succeed
in reaching it are known as self-actualized persons. Like
_ us, they also have various experiences and feelings; but
_ they are highly motivated to continuously strive to improve
themselves and move towards their ideal. Such people
who work with dedicatian to achieve their goals are
variously called as ‘ideal persons’, ‘perfect men’ etc.

3:25:11 Characteristics of Fully Functioning
Person

Rogers identified five characieristics of the fully
functioning person. They are:



============================================================
--- Page 83 ---
============================================================

150 Educational Psychology
te

1. Open to experience: They accept both positive
and negative emotions. Negative feelings are not denied,
but worked through (rather than resorting to ego defense
mechanisms) i.e. when they are overwhelmed with
negative feelings, they try to change them into positive
feelings. They accept failure and treat it as a stepping stone
for success by drawing appropriate lesson from the failure
and improve themselves.

2. Existential outlook in fife: They are in touch with
different experiences as they occur in life and avoid
prejudging and preconceptions. They live and appreciate
the present, without having the dissatisfaction of the past
or the worry over the future (i.e. living for the moment).

3. Trust feelings: Feeling, instincts and gut-reactions
are paid attention to and trusted; believing one’s own
decisions are the right ones and trust with confidence
that they are capable of making the right choices.

4. Creativity: Creative thinking and risk taking are
features of the life of a fully functioning person. A person
does not play safe all the time. This involves the ability to
adjust and change and seek new experiences.

5, Fulfilled life: A fully functioning person is happy
and satisfied with life, and is always looking for new
challenges and experiences.

in brief, fully functioning people are well adjusted
and emotionally well balanced, consider life is interes-
ting and curious to know anything and everything. Often
such people are high achievers in society.

3:26 Educational implications of Learning
Theories

From the different learning theories, it is clear that
‘earning’ is of different types and takes place at different
levels. Factors like pupil’s intelligence, his previous
experiences and the content of the subject more
particularly the topic to be learned, determine the method
of learning preferred by the pupil. To choose the most
appropriate method for the class-room teaching-learning
process, that is suitable for intellectual ability of his pupils,
and the nature of the content to be learned, the teacher
should have the knowledge of different learning theories
as well as their relative merits and demerits. No. single
theory of learning could be considered as the best.
Though the kit of a carpenter contains a variety of tools
and that too in different sizes, an efficient carpenter
chooses a particular tool among the many and puts it
into use in a given situation depending upon the nature
of the work to be done, nature of the wood.he has to deal
with, amount of time available to him to finish the work —
and the abilities of his assistant. For example if he has to
make a hole in a piece of wood, the carpenter may use a
chisel or a drill-bit depending upon the size of the hole to
be drilled and the strength of the wood he has to deal
with. Similarly a teacher should also know when to give
emphasis for acquisition of knowledge, when associations
and relationship are to be emphasized, when imitational
learning will be highly effective etc. so that he could create
the appropriate situations that facilitate the particular type
of learning or teaching. Hence knowledge about ‘earning’

4:01 Meaning of Intelligence

Psychologists have suggested various points of view
regarding the nature of intelligence. All the definitions
can be classified under the following three groups:

_ i) Ability for adjustment or adaptation: According
to this point of view, intelligence is the general mental
adaptability for new problems and new situations of life.
Thus more intelligent person is one who can more easily
and more extensively vary his behaviour as changing
conditions demand.

ii) Ability to learn : This view point emphasizes the
ability to learn i-e. one’s intelligence is a matter of the

Intelligence and Creativity 157

extent to which he is educable. The more intelligent a
person, ihe more readily and extensively he is able to
learn and enlarge his field of activities and experiences.

ill) Ability to carry on abstract thinking : Here
emphasis is laid on the effective use of concepts and
symbols in dealing with situations, especially presenting
a problem to be solved through the use of verbal and
numerical symbols.

The three categories of definitions of intelligence
stated above are not exclusive of each other but are
inclusive and interdependent on each other. No doubt,
on the surface these categories appear quite different;
but on critical examination it could be found that learning
ability is the basic requisite condition for the other two
aspects of intelligence.

4:02 Definitions of intelligence

1. Studdard speaks of intelligence, as the " ability
to start and sustain, inspite of emotional
interferences, activities that are difficult, novel and
useful in an economical manner”.

2. A very comprekensive and widely accepted
definition of intelligence has been given by Wechsler,
which states “Intelligence is the aggregate or global
capacity of an individual to act purposefully, to think _
rationally and to deal effectively with the
environment”. This definition encompasses all the three
major view points which regard intelligence as-



============================================================

============================================================

158 Educational Psychology

ee
i) adjustment or adaptation ability
ii) ability to learn
ili) ability to carry on abstract thinking
3. Alfred Binet considers intelligence as involving
such abilities as, "understanding, originality,
persistence and self-criticism".
4:03 Characteristic of an Intelligent Person
: An Intelligent person is one who,
i) learns fast and with ease.

ii) displays good adjustment in behaviour and has
the capacity to solve the problems he
encounters.

iii) is capable of successfully completing even
difficult and complex tasks with high
efficiency and that too economically.

iv) adjusts his behaviour according to the demands
of the goals which he seeks to attain.

v) generaily acts in pursuit of the welfare of the
society.

vi) does not get easily carried away by emotions
but focuses his attention and efforts on the
task in hand by mobilising all his energy and
resources at his command. —

vii) is capable of handling any trying situation and
win over it.

vill) has the ability to analyse any problem
thoroughly.

Intelligence and Greativity +59

ix) knows the knack of getting along with others
and bring them around his point of view.

x) British psychologists point out the following two
essential behavioural aspects exhibited by
intelligent persons :

a) Perceive the appropriate relations that exist
among objects or ideas.

b) Apply the relations so perceived to new
situations in life.

4:04 Types of Intelligence ic

Some Psychologists, notably Thorndike believe
that several kinds of intelligence should be distinguished
from each other. According to him intelligence is of three
kinds:

1. Social Intelligence : It refers to the knack of
getting along with people. Socially intelligent
person makes friends easily and understands
human relations. :

2. Mechanical Intelligence : It is the ability to
deal effectively with machines or mechanical
contrivances. ,

3. Abstract intelligence : It is the ability to deal
with symbols (both verbal and numerical),
diagrams, formulae etc.

Prof. Howard Gardener of Harward. university of
U.S.A. in his book "Frames of Mind : The Theory of
Multiple Intelligence” has posted a provisional list of


============================================================

160 Educational Psychology

intelligences which include linguistic and logical skills
(Which |. Q. tests measure), Musical skills, Kinesthetic
skills (exhibited by Surgeons, dancers etc.), Spatial
skills (displayed by Sculptors etc.), Interpersonal skilis
(important for politicians, salesmen etc.) and
Intrapersonal skills (exhibited by planners and
strategists)

4:05 Theories of Intelligence

There are many views regarding what constitutes -

“intelligence”. The different view points expressed by
psychologists regarding the structure and functioning of
intelligence go by the name theories of intelligence.
Important among them are presented below: ,

4:05:1 Unitary Theory or Monarchic Theory

This theory holds that intelligence consists of all
pervasive capacity. Binet, Terman and some other
classical psychologists supported this view. According to
this theory, if one has a fund of intelligence he can utilise
it to any area of his life, the intelligence of a person gets
stamped in all what he thinks and acts. But in our practical
life we see contrary to this. A genial mathematical
professor may be absent minded or socially ill-adjusted.
Further analysis of scores in an intelligence test battery

shows that different tests in the battery are not highly.

correlated. Hence it is suggested that the unifactor
approach is too simple and a complex model.is needed
to explain intelligence satisfactorily.

intelligence and Creativity +6T

4:05:2 Spearman's Two-factor Theory .

Spearman proposed his two-factor theory of,
intelligence in 1904. The first-factor was a general.
capacity which was basically a reasoning factor:,
According to this theory every different mental ability
involves a general factor (G), which it shares with all other:
mental activities and.a specific factor (S), which itshares
with none. 'G' factor is largely innate and accounts for
success in all activities. It is constant in the sense that
for any individual it remains the same of all the correlated
activities. It differs from individual to individual,. ,, But
success in any specialised field very much depends on
the concerned specific factor which is essentially jearrit.

‘Thus no person is absolutely uniform in -his mental
‘performance. So persons who are good in natural

sciences are poor in social sciences. Some who excel in
mathematics are poor in language. Thus, performance
in any situation is predicted by the amountdof-share of 'G’
and 'S' in different. intellect activities. ‘This can be
represented as follows:

G : General Factor {approximates to ‘common n sense}
S$: Specific Factors

4:05:3 Thorndike's Multifactor Theory

Thorndike was an associationist and he opposed
the theory of general intelligence (Unifactor theory). He
proposed that there are specific stimuli and. specific
response. Intelligence to him is nothing more than a
convenient name for almost infinite number of actual or
potential specific connections between these stimuli and
responses. Differences in intelligence among people are
due to the number of connections in the neurological
system. According to the theory, intelligence is said to be
“constituted of a multitude of separate factors or elements,
each being a minute element or ability (and hence this
theory is known as atomistic theory of intelligence). A
mental act according to this.theory involves a number of
these minute elements operating together. .|f. any two
tasks are correlated, the degree of correlation is due to
the common:elements involved in the two tasks.

Thorndike distinguished four attributes of
intelligence. They are: i ~

a) Level : This refers to the difficulty of a task that

can be solved. If we think of all test items arranged in a

sequential order of increasing difficulty, then the height
that we can ascend on this ladder of difficulty determine
our level or attitude of intelligence. —

b) Range : This refers to the number of tasks at any

given degree of difficulty that we can solve. Theoretically

an-individual possessing a given level of intelligence.
should be able to solve the whole range of tasks at that

intelligence and Creativity 162

level. ‘Range’ is determined not only by ‘evel’ but also
by the breadth of experience and. by opportunity to learn.
In intelligence tests, range is represented by items of
equal difficulty. ,

c) Area: it refers to the total number of situations
at each level to which the individual is able to respond.
Area is the summation of all the ranges at each level of
intelligence processed by an individual.

d) Speed : This is the rapidity with which an individual
can respond to items. Speed and attitude are positively
related. Speed is much closely bound up with attitude
than are the other attributes. We should not, therefore
emphasize speed too much in our intelligence tests.

Every intelligence test consists these four attributes.
When we test a person, wé give him certain number of
tasks (area) and these tasks vary in difficulty. (level) and
there are certain number of items at each level of difficulty
(range) and they are responded in. a.given time (speed).
Emphasis on these four attributes varies from test to
test. _ a
4:05:4 Thurstone's Group-factor Theory

Group factor theory has been advocated by
Thurstone and his associates. According to the group
factor theory, intelligent activity is not an expression of
innumerable highly spécific factors as Thorndike
claimed. Nor is itthe expression primarily of a general
factor as Spearman held. Instead, the analysis and



============================================================
--- Page 90 ---
============================================================

164 Educational Psychology

interpretations of Thurstone and others, ied them to the
conclusion that certain mental operations have in common
a ‘primary’ factor, which gives them psychological and
functional unity and which differentiates them from other
mental operations. These mental operations, then,
constitute a group. A second group of mental operations,
has its own unifying. primary factor’; a third group has a
third, and so on. Each of these.primary factors is said to
be relatively independent of others. From further analysis,
Thurstone and his colleagues concluded that seven
Primary Mental Abilities (PMA) emerged clearly enough
for identification and used in test design. They are:

_ 1. Space visualisation : The ability to visualise
geomeiric pattern in space.
2... Perceptual speed : Quick and accurate noting
of details.
3. . Numerical ability : Quickness and accuracy
in simple arithmetic operations. a

4. Verbal comprehension : Knowledge of

meaning and relationship of words.

5. Word fluency : Ability to think and us@ many
isolated words at a rapid rate.

6. Rote memory : Immediate recall of materials
learned.

7.. Reasoning : Ability to see relationships in

situations described in symbols.

4:05:4:01 Contributions of Thurstone's

Theory of Intelligence

Imporiant contributions of Thurstone's theory of
intelligence are :

a) More clearly specified and defined test categories
and type of test items to be included, emerged.

b) Several test batteries have been constructed on
the basis of group factor theory.

c) On the basis of the findings of this theory H.E.
Garret has postulated a developmental theoly of
intelligence in which he argues that with increasing
age, abilities differentiate out of general abstract
intelligence into relatively independent factors.

4:05:5 Guilford's Structure of Intellect

Structure of Intellect model is the result of factor
analysis conducted by Guilford and his associates in the
psychology laboratory at the University of South California
in 1966. Guilford suggests that mind is composed-of
atleast three major dimensions-Process of aperaticn,
material or content, and product.

Thus, according to Guilford, there can be only 180
different mental abilities, as a result of 6 processes
operating on any one of the 5 contents to produce any
one of the 6 products (6 X 5 X 6 = 180).

Guilford would not agree to the idea of some fixed
amount of intelligence. Instead he claims that
development of intellectual skill as in any other skill
depends on practice. Unlike others, Guilford is concerned
with the social behaviour of the individual in addition to

Intelligence and Creativity 169

academic success. Therefore he devised some tests of
social sensibility. He takes into account inter- -personal
skills. He refers to the dynamic cluster of. skills which
can always be improved.

defining specific learning outcomes. These elements
relating to convergent and divergent thinking have
stimulated considerable interest and investigation "High

focus on socially acceptable responses.

4:06 Howard Gardner's Theory of Multiple
Intelligence 5

Prof. Howard Gardner of Harward University of
U.S.A. in his book "Framer of Mind : The Theory of
Multiple Intelligence” (1983) has listed eight types of
intelligence. According to him, intelligence as measured
at present through the use of intelligence tests, is narrowly
conceived. Human intelligence ig really broad based and
of many kinds. Therefore attempting to assess’ such a
wide range of mental abilities"by the use of 3 single
measure Called 1.Q. is akin to caging an elephant in a
glass bottle. Keeping in mind the different kinds of human
mental abilities, he propsed an eightfold intelligence, a
brief description of which is presented as follows -

4:06:1 Gardner's Eight Types of Intelligence

il) Linguistic Intelligence : This represents the verbal
ability of an individual.

ii) Logical - mathematical Intelligence : Logical
reasoning and numerical skilis are included in this
category of intelligence.

The intelligence test which are presently in use to
assess the |.Q. of individuals attempt to measure
the above two-categories of mental abilities only.

iii) Spatial intelligence : This type of intelligence is.

largely displayed by sculptors, engineers,
atchitecis, draughtsmen, experts in drawing and
painting etc.

iv) Kinesthetic Intelligence : This type of intelligence
is displayed by Surgeons, dancers, sportsmen,
Therapists etc.

vy) Musical intelligence : Musicians, muscicologists,

and instrumental players like violinist, guitarist,

' pianoist étc. require this type of intelligence toa
greater degree. .

vi) Interpersonal Intelligence : This type of
intelligence is highly important for those who mingle
and deal with the public like Politicians, Salesmen,
Public Relations officers, Receiptionists, Business
Executives etc. requiring the skill to persuade and
win over peopie.

intelligence and Creativity 174

vil) Intra-personal Intelligence : This type of mental
abilities are exhibited by planners and
strategists.

viii) Naturalist Intelligence : This category of
intelligence is meant for Poets, Horticulturalisis,
Environmentalists, Planners who undertake
projects of environmental cleanliness and
Ecologists.

According to Gardner, our present school system
gives importance to promote the first two categories of
intelligence (Verbal and Numerical ability, Logital
reasoning) only. It should take equal interest in developing
other types of intelligence too in pupils so that experts in
fine arts like music, dance, drawing and painting etc.
renouned Surgeons, Designers, Therapists, Sportsmen,
Business Executives etc. could emerge in the society.

Unfortunately, our system of education instead of

identifying and fostering such special talents in children,
lables therm as those with ‘learning disability’ and dumps
them to discard. Those who have exceptional skills in
other fields, do not get due care and recognition in our
educational institutions for the simple reason that they
lag behind others in theirverbal and numerical abilities.
Gardner's Theory, of Multiple Intelligence insists on
bringing revolutionary changes in the instructional system.

_ Classroom instructional activities should become manifold

and multimodal. They should include multimedia learning,
graphical representations, field trips, self-reflections,
team projects, dramatisation, music etc. Then only each.

student in the class can learn using those categories of
activities appropriate to the type of intelligence dominant
in him / her. Learning becomes optimal and joyful only if
learner's potentials are exploited in the process of imparting
instruction. Today Gardner's Theory of Intelligence is
becoming quite popular among the educationalists,
psychologists and philosophers all over the world.

4:07 Measurement of Intelligence
4:07:1 Difficulty in Measuring Intelligence

Measurement of intelligence is not possible in the
same way as we measure the length of a table or the
temperature of boiling water, since intelligence is not a
concrete thing. It is only an idea and abstraction and
therefore its direct measurement is not possible,
Intelligence tesis.do not measure intellectual capacity in

action or behaviour. Itis believed that every human action |

has. some intelligence. behind it. The level of intelligence
an individual has is measured by (|) the difficulty of the
task he can perform; (ij) the range of tasks he can
perform; and. (ill) the speed with which he does.

To quote Samdiford, “the harder the task a person
can perform, the greater is his intelligence. Secondly,
more of tasks that an individual can do, the more
intelligence he has, and thirdly, the quicker the
response of an individual to the given task, the greater
his intelligence is”.

Intelligence and Creativity 173

4:07:2 Some of the Standardised Intelli-
gence Tests :

4:07:2:01 Stranford-Binet Test of Intelli-
gence
Alfred Binet, a French Psychologist, is known as the
father of intelligence testing. To devise test items for
estimating intelligence, Binet started with certain
assumptions regarding certain functional aspects of
intelligence.

a) Intelligence does not refer to one or two narrow
abilities but a complex variety of abilities and so testing
intelligence should involve a variety of tests assessing
higher order mental functions. Tests of perceptual and
muscular skills are useless.

b) Intelligence is best displayed -by general
information.and knowledge and is independent of school
learning. So Binet chose items which a normal child of a
particular age could answer from its. out-of-school

“experience.

¢) The more intelligent individual shows greater
initiative and persistence, is more careful in observing
details and chalking out a‘consistent plan of activity and
he is able to take and maintain’a definite direction in
thinking when faced with a problematic situation.

d) Intelligence increases in amount as age increases.
So Binet introduced simpler items: for younger children
and more difficult and complex items for older children.

The 1905 scale of intelligence of Binet and Simon



============================================================
--- Page 95 ---
============================================================

174 Educational Psychology
lt
contained 30 items and a child's intelligence was roughly
computed by taking into account the number of items
out of the 30, answered correctly by it. Such items as
removing the paper wrapper before putting a candy into
mouth, the difference between paper and cardboard,
sentence completion, etc. were included. The scale of
intelligence was revised and reissued by Binet in 1908.
In this revision, the tests were arranged for different age
ievels, enabling the computation of mental age (M.A.).

4:07:2:02 Concept of Mental Age

The Mental Age is defined as "an expression of
the extent of development achieved by the individual,
stated in terms of the performance that can be
expected atany given age". Mental age generally refers
to mental maturity of a person corresponding to his level

of performance in an intelligence test, irrespective of his
chronological age. If a person of chronological age 8
years is able to score satisfactorily on a test meant for
children.of chronological age 10, then the mental age of
the former is 10.

4:07:3 - Concept of Intelligence Quotient

(1.Q,)

Intelligence Quotient is an index of intelligence. His
a comparative index showing how a particular child
performs when compared with others of the same
chronological age. 1.Q. is computed as a ratio between
Mental age (M.A.} [as obtained from one's performance
on astandardised intelligence test] and chronologicabage
{Computed from his date of birth : however C.A. is taken

Intelligence and Creativity 175
enti
as 16 for persons whose ages are 16 and above as. most
psychologists believe that growth of intelligence stops at
16 after reaching maturity). To avoid fractions we multiply
the result obtained by 100.

ie. 1.Q. aS x 100

1.Q. value 100 refers to normal (average) intelligence;
values above 100 indicate high intelligence and vaiues
below 100 refer low level-of intelligence.

4:07:3:01 Wechsler’s Adult Intelligence
Scale (WAIS) ;

Wechsler's Adult Intelligence ‘Seale (WAIS)
published in 1939 was modified and standardised i in 1955.
Wechsler adopts a general intelligence approach. This
view supported that individuals have different measures
of intelligence and noi of thé same kind of intelligence.

_ Sub-tests measure the different ways the intelligence may

manifest itself.

The test consists of 11 sub-tests - six of the tests
are grouped together to form a verbal scale and five
comprise performance scale.
a) Verbal Scale tests

WAIS is a Point Seale and not an Age Scale like
Stranford Binet test. Here items are not grouped by age
level as in Binet test. But an individual score is based on
the number of items scored correctly. The raw score for
each sub-test is transformed into standard-score witha
mean of 10 and Standard deviation of 3. The WAIS is
supposed to give ‘quite a reliable measure of adult
intelligence. The verbal and performance I.Qs have split-
half reliabilities of more than 0.93 and the total scale |.Qs
have spilit-haif reliability co-efficient of 0.97 for different
age groups.

4:07:4 Classroom Teacher Assessing the

Intelligence of his Students

Teachers with a little amount of training can
administer suitable standardised intelligence tests to
their students and estimate their |.Qs. Following are the
steps to be followed:

a) First of all, a suitable standardised intelligence
test (standardised to our socio-economic
culture backgrounds) should be selected, with
the help of psychologists if needed.

intelligence and Creativity 177
ence
b) The manual of the test should be carefully read
and understood w.r.t. administration, scoring
and interpretation.

c) Next, a suitable testing climate has to be
created in which the pupil would be able to take
the test without fear or nervousness and
perform the best of his intellectual abilities.

d) The pupil should be instructed-to commence
the test items at a level 2 years below his
chronological age. On successful completion,
the pupil should be encouraged to proceed
ahead with the items in the test which are ar-
ranged according to increasing age levels. The
‘Basal Age' should be determined.

Basal Age

Basal age is that age, all the test items meant for
which are solved by the child successfully. Consider a
child of chronological age (actual age as obtained from
his date of birth) 8. He solves all questions meant for
children of chronological age 10. But he solves only 20 —
questions out of 60 questions in a test meant for children
of chronological age 14. The basal age of the child
referred to here with chronological age of 8 is 10. We
can observe that the basal age is 7 in the illustration given
below (in the table)

e) Atone stage the child may not answer correctly
any test item further in the test. At this stage
we stop the test and note down the age, from

Verbal Non-Verbal Performance Verbal Non-Verbal
4:08:1 Individual and Group Tests

Individual tests of intelligence can be used to test
only one subject at a time. If many are tobe tested, each
has to be done so separately and individually resulting in
enormous expenditure of time and energy. Such individual
tests may also penalise the bright but shy and nervous

_ children who do not display their best when directly facing

the tester. To get over these obvious limitations of
individual testing, group tests of intelligence were

_ developed.

The first group tests developed were Army Alpha
Test (for those who knew the English language) and Army
Beta Test (for those who are not versed in English ard
consisting of digits and diagrams). These group tests are

_ paper and pencil tests and there is a time limit for
completing the test. It was believed that one who could
_ comprehend correctly and complete quickly-the tasks set
_ by the test items had great intelligence than. one who
- could not so well. Army beta group test does not involve
_ language. Subjects are required to resporid to each item

just by putting a mark next to the appropriate picture or
diagram. Following the army group tests of intelligence,
many standardised group tesis of intelligence like the
Stanford-Binet tests of Terman, Otis group tesis of
intelligence, Kuhiman-Anderson group tests, etc. have
been developed. Group tests of intelligence contain a
variety of items of which the following are sample types

i) vocabulary items

ii) word analogies items

iii} sentence completion items

iv) tests of mathematical reasoning
v) number series

vi) classification

vii) following directions

vill)’ picture arrangement tests

ix) memory for designs

x) absurdities test

xi) common sense tests

xii) digit-symbo! substitution tests
xii} paper and pencil mazes, etc.

Some of these are symbolic and pictorial items and
others are verbal and abstract items. For the younger
age groups test items often make much use of objects,
pictures and concrete items and as age increases words
and abstractions become more stressed.

4:08:1:01 Advantages of Group Tests of
Intelligence

1) As many can be tested at the same time, they
are economical. :

2) They permit shy and socially withdrawn
subjects to display their best in test situations.

3) Administration of group tests is also
comparatively easy. Stencil scoring as well as
mechanical devices help in quick and accurate
scoring of large number of test papers ina very
short time.

4:08:1:02 Limitations of Group Tests of

intelligence
1

~~

They are not of much use in attempting an
indepth study of a single person's intelligence.

2) Paper and pencil group tests often resemble
class or school examinations and children who
have developed negative attitude towards
examinations may transfer such attitudes to
menial tests

3) Group tests have a time limit and hence bring
pressure of time and tension on the testees.

4) Children who have reading difficulties may have
problems in comprehending what is expected
of them in such tests and their scores may be
lower than what they should really be.

Group tests of intelligence are useful when the


============================================================
--- Page 99 ---
============================================================

182 Educational Psychology

intelligence of many persons has to be roughly measured
for some practical purpose in a short period of time
available.

4:08:2 Verbal and Performance Tests

The early tests of intelligence were verbal or linguistic
in nature, So to take such tests, knowledge of language
of the test is necessary. The verbal tests of intelligence
have certain disadvantages. Some may give wrong
responses not because they lack sufficient intelligence
but because of misunder-standing of the language items
in such tests. Similarly those whose mental abilities are
not higher but who have language proficiency may score
high in verbal tests. Aiso linguistic tests of intelligence
cannot be applied to test the abilities of those who do not
know the language, very young children, tribal or
aboriginals and those with sensory handicaps. To get over
these limitations performance tests of intelligence were
devised. (Performance tests are non-verbal; but all non-
verbal tests need not be performance tests). Non-verbal
tests such as matrices, mazes, etc. do not use words but
use symbols and diagrams and other perceptual designs;
whereas performance tests of intelligence make use of
concrete objects with which the subject has to do
something. Performance tesis of intelligence assess the
behaviour arising out of intelligence and involve doing
certain standardised tasks using ordinary materials like
cubes, beads, etc: with which one is familiar. Tests
devised by Pinter and Patterson, Collins and Draver,
and Bhatia (for Indian children) are some popular

Intelligence and Creativity 183

performance tests of intelligence. Bhatia’s tests of
intelligence includes: (i) Koh's Block Design test (ii)
Alexander's Pass Along test (ili) Pattern-Drawing test
(iv) Immediate Memory test for digits and (v) Picture
construction test. In estimating the mental level of
performance, the time taken to complete the assigned
task as well as the errors committed in the course of
performance are taken into account and the M.A. arrived
at from the table of norms provided with the test battery.

4:08:2:01 When to Use Performance Tesis?

As ihe results obtained fron verbal and performance
tests correlate only to a moderate extent, performance
tests can not be used as good substitutes for verbal tests

of intelligence. However they can be used for those who

have sufficient linguistic ablity, along with verbal
intelligence tests so as to get a complete understanding
about their intelligence.

Generally performance tests of intelligence are
preferred in those situations where verbal tests could not
be employed effectively i.e. for those who have either no
or poor linguistic ability, very young children, tribal or
aboriginals and those with sensory handicaps.

4:08:2:02 Limitations of Performance Tesis
1) Administering and interpreting. performance

tests of intelligence requires specially trained
personnel.

2) There appears to be little positive. correlation
between one's score in verbal and in

2)

performance tests of intelligence and so
performance tests are not as reliable as verbal
tests nor should they be used as substitutes
for verbal tests. They should be used only when
verbal or perceptual non-linguistic tests cannot
be used.

They cannot predict scholastic achievement.
Performance test materials are costly.

Many factors other than intelligence seem to
help success in performance tests.

Performance tests cannot be used as group
tests.

Many materials used in performance tests of
intelligence appear similar to the sophisticated
toys with which children from higher socio-
economic groups may be familiar and such
children due to familiarity with material may
score high though they may not really have
‘such high mental ability.

Uses of Intelligence Tests

Intelligence tests help in providing educational
and vocational guidance.

They give the most valuable objective
information regarding level and quality of
mental abilities of children.

3) They help in classifying students into

_ homogeneous groups of ability or performance.

4:10

Inigiligence and Creativity 185

They heip in diagnosing the causes for back-
wardness. :

They help in predicting future progress.

They are useful in selecting individuals for
different jobs.

They are used in research in Psychology and
Education: ;

They are used in clinics and mental! hospitals
in order to record the effectiveness of the

&

Limitations of Intelligence Tests

1)

It is really difficult to say that intelligence tests

have cent per cent validity and they measure ;

only native mental capacity.

Socio-cultural differences, lack of interest or
coaching, test unreliability and many other
factors make us careful in not fully accepting
the computed |.Q. as a true indication of pupil's
mental worth.

intelligence tests are also culture-specific and
not completely culture-fair.

Intelligence tests cannot use scales which have
a known zero point and equal intervals.
Therefore a person who does not answer any
item correctly in an intelligence test is not
necessarily totally lacking in intelligence. Simi-
larly a derived score of 140-does not represent


============================================================
--- Page 101 ---
============================================================

186 Educational Psychology

twice the intelligence of a derived score of 70;
it simply represents more intelligence.

5) Measured I.Qs. are affected by testing climate,
familiarity of the individual with test items,
emotional interference, etc.

4:11 Culture-Fair Tests

In should be remembered that most of the
intelligence tests are culture specific and the items often
favour socio-economic groups which the test conductor
is linked. This bias may not be conscious but is there.
Matters taken for granted in one culture can not be taken
for granted in another culture; this applies equally to
deprived sub-cultures within more advanced cultures in
the same society. Further, mental tests emphasize speed
and in non-competitive cultures, speed is not valued as
much as slowness. It is for this reason that what are
known as “culture free” or “culture fair" tests of
intelligence are attempted to be constructed now. Certain
tests devised by Cattell which consists of items of
classification, completion of series, matrices and spatial
perception and the progressive matrices of Ravan (it
consists of figures and designs; the subject apprehends
relationship between figures and selects appropriate part
for completion of each pattern of system of relations)
appear to be culture-free and applicable to children of
different cultures as well as socio-economic levels.

4:12 Meaning of ‘Creativity’

Creativity is the capacity of the individual to discover
or produce new ideas. It may also include restructuring

intelligence and, Creativity 487

or rearranging the old idea. The only precaution for
renaming an expression as creative is that it should not
be a mere repetition or reproduction of what has already
been experienced or learned.

Ausubel defines creativity as “a rare capacity for
developing insights, sensitivities and appreciations
in a circumscribed content area of intellectual or
artistic activities”.

Torrance speaks of creativity as a mental process
of seeing or creating most unforeseen and novel
relationships between two or more things or ideas. Infact
according to Terrance two stages are involved in this
process (i) to shake and throw things together, and to
discriminate from a variety of different possibilities and
(ii) to synthesize and bring together elements in a new
and original ways.

Bruner states that all forms of creativity grow out of
a combinational activity, a placing of thing in new
perspective.

Drevdahl defines creativity as the capacity of a
person to produce compositions, products or ideas which
are essentially new or novel and previously unknown to
the producer. ’ ;

in the words of C.R. Rogers “Creative process is
the emergence in action of a novel relation or product,
growing out of the uniqueness of the individual on

the one hand, and the materials, evenis, people or

circumstances of his life on the other”.

188 Educational Psychology

4:12:1 Nature (Characteristics) of Creativity

1. The end product of creative thinking should be
something tangible such as a poem, a piece of
music, a scientific theory or a new mechanical
or electrical contrivance.

2. Everyone possesses creative powers to some
degree.

3, Although creative abilitiés are natural
endowments, yet they are capable of being
nourished or nurtured by training or education.

4. Any creative expression is a source of joy and
satisfaction to the creator. There is perfect
individuality in one’s creative expression.

5. The creator is the person who is able to make
ego involved statements like ‘It is my idea’, ‘I
have solved the problem’, etc. In creative
expression, there is complete ego involvement.

6. Creativity involves divergent thinking, having |

freedom for multiplicity of responses, choices
and lines of action. By travelling on the routine,
beaten track one cannot create but only
reproduce or repeat.

7. The field of creative expression is very wide. It

covers all the aspects of human accomplish-
menis like scientific inventions and discoveries,

composing of poems, writing of stories and —

dramas and good performance in the field of

dance, music, painting, sculpture, political and —

intelligence and Creativity 1a9

social leadership, business, teaching and other
professions.

8. The important components of creativity as
identified by J.P. Guilford and Torrance are :
i) ideational fluency;
ii) originality
iii) flexibility;

iv) divergent thinking;

v) persistence;

vi) self-confidence:

vii) sensitiveness: and

vill) ability to see relationships and make ©
associations.

4:13 Stages in the Process of Creative
Thinking

Graham Wallas and Patrick (independently) have

- indicated four stages of creativity. They are preparation,

incubation, illumination and verification (and revision if
needed).

1.Preparation : In ibe preparation stage, the problem
is defined and explained. it means orientation with the
problem and involves purposeful study, discussion with
others and acquisition of facts. Relevant facts and
materials considered essential are gathered. The plan of
action is formulated. Creative work is largely work of
diligence and industry. Perspiration, rather than
inspiration is proper preparation. No painter, poet,


============================================================

============================================================

490 Educational Psychology
nO
scientist or novelist has reached great eminence
overnight and almost every creative thinker reports that
he worked laboriously during his early days.

2.Incubation : This stage is characterised by overt
behaviour. During this stage one can make rest or sleep
or do even some other problem. Just as nothing is added
to the egg but only it is kept warm, so during the period
of incubation no new knowledge or experience is added
to the existing stock. During this stage there is no external
disturbance. it is common experience that we sometimes
forget an important name. If recalling is postponed, later
on it comes to our mind. Hurry and compulsion are fatal
to creativity. In incubation, the mind is relaxed. If
incubation is hastened it will result in abortion.

3.1Humination : Incubation leads to illurnination.
During this stage, there is the sudden appearance of the
solution to the problem. In the case of the chimpanzees
in Kohler’s experiment, there was the sudden dawn of

insight, fesulting in the connection of the sticks with the —

fruit. So iltumination implies insight. Illumination may
"occur any time, even during dreams.

4,Verification : Then comes the final stage, that of
verification. During this stage, we determine whether the
solution is the correct one or not; sometimes the
solution needs some modification. This is the
evaluation of the solution of the problem. Then in the

light of the results of verification or testing, revision is.

made till the solution is workable. These stages. should

Intelligence and Creativity : 194

not be considered as rigid and fixed. One may get the
illumination without passing through incubation. In
certain cases, the cycle has to be repeated till. they
get at the solution. Creativity as a natural endowment
needs stimulation and nourishment.

4:14 Differences Between Intelligence and
Creativity.

1. It has been established that convergent
thinking is the basis of intelligence, whereas
divergent thinking forms the basis of creativity.
Divergent thinking is stimulus free and often goes
beyond the data i.e. divergent thinking searches for
many possible responses for a given stimulus.
Convergent thinking on the other hand is stimulus
bound and is limited to the data given. Tradition and
rules of logic deal with convergence in thought, with
conclusion following the premises. But originality is
identified with divergent thinking. In convergent
thinking, an individual has the tendency to find out the
one most appropriate idea or socially approved
response whereas divergent thinking allows as many
responses as possible.«

2. it has been observed that highly creative
persons are usually found to possess intelligence to a
high degree but it is not essential for an intelligent
person to be creative. One may possess high
intelligence without having creative abilities. On the
other hand, an adequate level of intelligence is a


============================================================
--- Page 104 ---
============================================================

192 Educational Psychology
en inna
necessary condition for being creative. A mentally
retarded cannot be expected to be creative.

3. In intelligence testing, the speed and accuracy of
the cognitive behaviour is emphasized while in creative
tests novelty, flexibility, originality, fluency and elaboration
are given more weightage.

Thus it could be concluded that intelligence and
creativity are related (having low positive correlation) but
not synonymous.

4:15 Identification of the Creative Children

The term ‘creativity’ cannot be used synonymously
with giftedness. Creativity in all its shapes and forms is
the highest expression of giftedness that may or may not
be found in a particular gifted child. Creative children
could be identified by employing any of the two
approaches : ;

j. Making use of tests of creativity;

ii.. Making use of non-testing devices like
observation, interview, rating scale, personality
inventory, check lists, etc.

4:15:71 Use of Tests of Creativity

Today there are many specific tests are available for
assessing creativity, the notable ones being Paul
Torrance’s Minnesota Tests of creative Thinking,
Remote Associative Test, Wallach and Kogan's
Creativity Instruments, Guilford’s Test of creativity and

Baquer Mehdi’s Test of Creative Thinking. They employ

intelligence and Creativity 192

generally verbal and non-verbal items. Verbal items are
like the following :

1. Unusual uses of ordinary things like a tin can
or a card board box

2. Possible consequences of an impossible event

3. Producing ideas for improving a toy to increase

a. Picture construction test
b. Incomplete figures to be completed

i. Keen observation

ii. Indulge in activities with total devotion —
iii. Keen desire to listen others
iv. Using analogies much in their speech

v. Energetic and enthusiastic, spending a jot of
time in reading, writing, drawing eic.

4:16 Fostering Creativity among Children

Creativity is an attribute that leads to solving problem
in-new ways; therefore, the educational objectives, the
methodology of learning and stimulating environment and
the evaluative techniques, ali have to be reconstructed
so that the creative abilities of students may be

developed. The following are the blocks to creative thinking, .

which have to be removed :

a. high standards of achievement for low levels
of work such as routine skills of unimportant
maiterial;

Intelligence and Creativity 195
a=

b. inflexibility of assignments and methods of

work;
c. over-emphasis on school marks; and
d. the authoritarian teacher.
Gallagher makes the following suggestions for the

development of creativity of pupils :

i. organise the curriculum primarily on the basis
of concepts rather than facts;

li. allow more individual assignments under
competent supervision; “*

ili. bring the students in contact with the best talent
and knowledge available from the teaching
staff;

iv. follow the general philosophy that truth is
something to be sought for rather than
revealed;

v. provide inservice teacher education for more
competence in both subject mastery and
method of teaching.

Torrance suggests five steps for fostering creativity
among pupils : Ea

1. Be respectful of unusual questions.
2. Be respectful to imaginative unusual ideas.
3. Show your pupil that their ideas have value.

4. Occasionally pupils do something for practice
without the threat of evaluation.


============================================================

196 Educational Psychology
nen mm
5. Evaluate with causes and consequences.
instead of saying, “this is good” and “that is
bad”, point out the consequences that this and
that lead to and children evaluate the goodness
or badness of various results.

; Use of special technique called “Brain Storming”
for facilitating the production of novel ideas was
suggested by Osborn in 1963. Brain storming which
consists of having group members suggest ideas. as
rapidly as possible, prohibiting criticism, encouraging
speaking out and evaluating af a later session, holds
possibilities that have not yet been thoroughly tested.

Bruner as well as Suchman suggest the use of
discovery and inquiry methods in teaching in order to
foster creativity among children.

Wallach and Nathan Kogan believe that the
gamelike, relaxed, untimed and evaluative situation is
necessary for the fullest expression of creativity.

Demos and Gowan held that instructor’s role in
furthering the student's creativity is a protective and

nurturing one and appears to consist of the following steps ~

or phases.

1. Inspiration : Inspire the student to learn to
disagree or emulate.

2. Stimulation : Provide for exciting and new.

experiences in the curriculum

Intelligence and Creativity 197

3. Psychological safety and freedom : Provide
a warm, safe and permissive atmosphere in
which the creative students fee! accepted.

4, Guided discovery : Provide direction to a level
and area where it is most effective for learning
by independent discovery on the part of the
student.

§. Encouragement : Develop child’s ideas
through constructive criticism and refer to
competent authorities, to. book and other
sources. *

Summing up the above, it could be stated that the
following are the techniques of promoting creativity
among the children.

i. Freedom to express without any hesitation or
fear .

il. Encourage originality and flexibility; welcome
unusual ideas however silly they may be

ili. Encourage enquiry spirit in children

iv. Test items in examination should not test pup |s’
memory powgr alone; they should Le
challenging and stimulate pupils’ divergent
thinking [(eg.) Instead of asking the traditional
question “what are the advantages to India
due to the Himalayas?” frame questions like
“if the Himalayas were not there what would
have happened to India?” which develop
lateral thinking in students.]

Unit V
PERSONALITY

5:00 introduction.

This Unit attempts to explain the meaning of the term
‘personality’, its determinants, the three approaches
followed in describing human personality and their merits
and demerits, characteristics of 'Extroverts' and ‘Introverts’
Frued's Psycho-analytic theory of personality, concept of
‘Integrated Personality’, three Important Approaches in
the Assessment of Personality viz. Subjective Methods,
Objective Methods, Projective Technique, Various
Assessment Methods under each of them and their merits
and limitations are to be discussed in detail.

5:01 Meaning of the term ‘Personality’

The term ‘persenality’ has been derived from the
Latin root ‘persona’ which referred to the facial mask
worn by Roman actors on the stage. It was the masked
face, that the actor presented to the audience and perhaps
this mask determined how a person is perceived by others
and how he affects othereople. But the term ‘personal-
ity’ today means many things to many people. Many
people look upon personality in a narrow sense as
implying bodily or physical attractiveness. Also, anyone
who displays in a superlative degree certain

-commendable traits is designated as a great personality,

indirectly implying that ordinary and average men and

women do not have personalities. But psychologically
every individual, whatever be his status in society, is a
personality or has a distinct personality.

Each person has a unique and relatively stable,
persisting organisation of characteristics that go to make
up his individual personality. Personality refers to the
“totality of what a person is”, which includes all traits
(physical, psychological as well as a variety of acquired
habitual traits) blended or organised within him in a
characteristically unique manner that determines his
modes of behaviour and his adjustments to the
environment.

“An individual’s personality is the resuiting
individuality arising out of the interaction of a self-
conscious and intelligent person and the environment
in which he lives”. (F.S. Freeman)

“The fact that a man eats, sleeps and works does
not define his personality, rather his personality is defined
by what he eats, how he sleeps and what is distinctive
about his work pattern.” “Individuality or uniqueness
characterises one's personality. The consistent and
characteristic ways of functioning of an individual reveals
his personality”. (J.P. Guilford)

G.W. Allport has given a comprehensive definition
of personality which recognises the value of wholeness,
adjustment and distinctiveness of man's ‘personality’.
According to him “personality is a dynamic

Personality : 203

organisation within the individual of those psycho-
physical systems that determine his characteristic
behaviour and thought.”

5:03 Characteristics of Personality

From the various definitions of the term 'personality’,
following facts regarding personality could be arrived at:

i) personality is self-consciousness;
ii) itis through and through social;
iti) itis dynamic;
iv) it is the product of heredity and environment;

it is adjustable or modifiable;

)

vi) it is unique;
) itis integrated and functions as a whole;
)

it is assessable.

5:04 Uses of the Knowledge of Personality
to Teachers

i) The personality factors of pupils affect their learning
and performance in classes and knowledge of personality
characteristics of pupils is needed to give them proper
guidance. ii) Recognition of disturbed personalities of
some people will help teachers to have immediate
recourse to professional assistance so that serious. diffi-
culties may be averted. iii) Even from a personal angle,
much of our time is spent in irying to weigh up the
personalities of those around us and trying to influence
them or adjusting to them. For this purpose too, a

knowledge of ourselves, our personality traits and aiti-
tudes are essential.
5:05 Factors Influencing Personality
Development

Man, the social animal has both a body and mind.
His Personality is influenced by biological, psychological
and social factors. These three major factors and their
subcomponents are given below :

Personality Factors

Biological Sociological Psychological
Factors ' Factors Factors
i) Physique i) Home i) intelligence
ii) Chemique ii) School ii) Motivation
(endocrine glands) iii) Language iii) Emotion
iii} Nervous system iv) Culture iv) Attitude
v) Interest

vi) Sentiment

_Among these factors some are due to heredity and
others arise due to environmental influences. Among the
heredity factors most important are biological factors and
some of the psychological factors like intelligence. The
individual's biological constitution is a predisposing factor.
ti determines the general direction in which his personality
is likely to develop.

5:05:1 Biological Factors

There are three biological factors in development.

Personality 205

They are
i) Physique
ii) Chemique
iii) Nervous system

i) Physique : Height, weight, physical appearance,
physical strength, general health, physical deformities and
abnormalities influence the personality of an individual
not directly but indirectly. The child who is short statured
and physically handicapped may develop a feeling of
inferiority. The crippled persons are emotionally
unbalanced. The bodily differences do influente a
person's behaviour. The fat person may be some what
lethargic while the lean and thin person may be a bit more
active. Everyone likes beautiful objects and persons;
those who are ugly are discarded: All these things greatly
affect one's self-estimation or self-concept which is inti-
mately related to the development of personality.

ii) Chemique : By chemigue is meant the possible
effects of the ductless glands on the personality
development. Thyroid gland secretes a chemical known
as thyroxine, which controls rate of growth. When the
gland is underactive the individual becomes.lethargic and
despondent. When this gland is overactive, the individual
becomes restless, irritable and unstable.

The parathyroid gland produces calcium salts. When
this gland is underactive, the individual becomes
excessively high at activity level. When this gland is
overactive, the individual becomes quiet and slow in
activities. :


============================================================
--- Page 111 ---
============================================================

206 Educational Psychology
ee

The other glands like the pituitary, the sex gland, and
the adrenal gland affect the behaviour of the individual
and then his personality. These ductless glands do
interlocking activities; they are stimulating one another,
inhibiting one another and compensating one another.
They play an important role in bodily, mental, and
emotional! development.

iii) Nervous system : The efficiency of the sensory
organs depends upon the weil-developed quality of the
nervous system and we know that the sensory organs
are the gateways of knowledge. Our intellectual efficiency,
physical power, patience, the quickness of adjustment,
the readiness of acquiring new modes of responses, our
reasoning and thinking all depend on the efficiency of
the nervous system. Any injury to the system will affect
the personality of the individual.

5:05:2 Social Factors

Home, schooi, language and culture are the most
important sociological factors in influencing one's
personality.

1) Home : The different forces which influence the
personality in a home are:

i) Parental attitudes towards their children :
Parental rejection (unwanted children), over-protected
children, the only child in the family, children left in the
éare of the servants, etc. lead to distorted personality
development. Broken home, separated or divorced

Personality 207

parents, alcoholic parents, quarrelsome parenis, etc.
decisively affect the personality make up of the children.

i) Over-ambitious parents : Over-ambitious parents
want their children to achieve something which is beyond
their capacities. The result will be failure, loss of self-
respect, feeling of guilt and shame.

iii) Parental preference on the sex of the child :
Most of the parents have strong preference for boys in
our country. This results in pampering of the male children
and neglect of female children, which is highly unhealthy
for the optimum personality development of children.

iv) Step parents : Loss of any one or both parents,
children under the care of step parents, children living in
orphanages, etc. are mainly responsible for stunted
growth and personality make up of children.

v) Number of children in the family : Only child as
well as over-crowded homes will have different kinds of
undesirable impact on the development of personality of
children.

vi) Educational and socio-economic status of
parents : Educational and socio-economic status of
parents do have a telling effect upon the personality
development of their children.

vil) Other factors at home : Child-rearing practices
such as breast-feeding versus boitle-feeding, early versus
late weaning, severe versus permissive toilet training,
authoritarian versus democratic way of treatment at home

OR A

will have a lot to do in shaping and developing the
personality of the children.

11) School : Various factors in the school are
responsible in. shaping the personality of the children.
They are (i) personality of the teachers; (ji) discipline of
the school: (iii) opportunity available for various curricular
and co-curricular activities; (iv) size of the school and the
organisational climate in the school, eic.

1H) Culture : The culture in which a child is reared
exerts the broadest kind of social influence on him. Each
individual wants to succeed in his cultural group in the
three important components-occupation, marriage, and
interpersonal relationships. These are largely shaped by
the different social agencies. Cultural differences in liv-
ing habit like mode of dressing, eating, attitudes to
marriage, methods of bringing up children, family life,
value system, beliefs, etc. affect the moulding of
personality pattern of the individual. It is also true that
geographical differences also contribute to cultural dif-
ferences and hence geographical environment also
indirectly plays a role in shaping the personality of an
individual.

5:05:3. Psychological Factors
One's intelligence, motivation, attitude, emotion,

interest and sentiment are the important psychological
factors that affect the personality development.

Personality 209

5:06 Theories of Personality

Psychologists adopt the following three major
approaches to.describe personality.

(i) Type-approach : This approach to personality
attempts to classify people accerding to their psycho-
somatic types or some central themes like leadership
style, value etc.

(ii) Trait-approach : The trait-approach attempts to
list a number of basic personality traits and the personality
of an individual can be described by its position on a ¥ or
9 point scale, in each of these units.

(ill) Type cum Trait Approach : This approach
integrate the type and trait approaches to describe
individual's personality. In this hierarchial approach,
starting with the basic categories of personality, the
corresponding traits for each personality category are
identified in the next level and finally ending with specific
behavioural responses for each trait. Eysenck's theory
of personality is a typical example for this approach.

5:06:1 Type Approach to Personality.

Type approach to pérsonality attempts to classify
people into a few types, each characterising certain styles
of life, which gives it a separate identity.

—-5:06:1:01 Galen's Classification

Galen has classified people into four types according

-to their temperament as (i) Choleric (irritable)


============================================================
--- Page 113 ---
============================================================

210 Educational Psychology
es

(ii) Melancholic (sad) (iil) Phlegmatic (sleepy) and
(iv) Sanguine (smiling).

5:06:1:02 Kretchmer’s Classification

Earnest Kretchmer, a German Psychiatrist refers to
three broad types of human personality based on bodily
build - (i) Aesthenic (thin, long limbed and narrow
chested) who are shy, sensitive, aloof and withdrawing.
(ii) Pyknic (short, fat and barrel chested) who are jovial,
lively, outgoing with fluctuating moods. (iii) Athletic (with
strong and sturdy limbs and bones). The athletic and
aesthenic types of body build go with what is known as
Schizothyme personality and the pyknic body type goes

-with Cyclothyme personality. The former is basically
introverted and the latter extroverted. These personality
types are each prone to a distinct type of mental disorder.

5:06:1:03 Spranger’s Classification

_ Edward Spranger, a German philosopher divided
human beings, on the basis of values (or) interest in the
following six categories:

i) Theoretical: Persons: who are theoretical in
nature, neglect social and political
participation.

ii) Economic : Those persons who are interested

in money-hoarding

: Those persons who love beauty
and are busy in sensuous
gratification

iii) Aesthetic

Personality ati

iv) Social : Persons who are interested in
social activities

v) Political : Dominating and desirous of power

vi) Religious : Persons who devote themselves to
religious activities and mysticism.

Allport, Vernon and Lindzey have constructed an

" inventory to study the above six values.

§:06:1:04 Sheldon's Classification

Dr. William H. Sheldon, an American Surgeon,
classified human beings into three broad categories of
physical dimensions and their corresponding
temperamental characteristics. The three personality
types are (a) Endomorphic (round, fat and soft) (b) Ec-
tomorphic (delicate, lean and linear body build) (c)
Mesomorphy (hard and muscular): Endomorphic
individuals have the type of viscerotonia, Mesomorphs
have somatotonia and Ectomorphs have Cerebrotonia.

Temperamenially Viscerotonia implies love ofleisure,
desire for enjoyment, desire for food and sleep, interest
in child-hood experiences, eic. Cerebrotonia implies
disciplined behaviour, ready response to stimulation, lack
of interest in social interactions, hypersensitivity to pain etc.

Somatotonic personalities exhibit persistance in
behaviour, desire for adventure, courage, indifference to
pain, involvement in actions, etc. Sheldon points out that
each type of body dimension for an individual may be
rated on a7 point scale and the normal physique will be
4-4-4.

(a) Authoritarian (forces his decisions ruthlessly

§:06:1:06 Ogburn's Classification

Sociologists like Ogburn classify human personality
as (i) Revolutionist (ii) Leader (iii) Proud (iv) Gambler and
{v) Exhibitionist.

5:06:1:07 Jung's Classification

The most popular personality types are those
introduced by Cari Jung - Extroversion and Introversion.
One who exhibits extroversion is an extrovert and
opposed io him is the introvert. The extrovert is readily
susceptible to external stimulation; he likes to get deeply
involved in social activities; he is not very much bothered
by outside criticisms; he displays his emotions openly, is
less worried about failure and lacks the power of seif-
criticism. But the Introvert is immersed in his own
thoughts, memories and imaginations and is indifferent
to social situations. He often tends to conceal his
emotions, is highly sensitive to criticisms and deeply upset
by failure. He is invariably self-centred. This classification

has been criticised on the ground that in general people

have characteristics of extroversion and introversion
mixed in them at different levels and exhibit one type of
characteristics dominantly in orie situation and the other
_ set of characteristics in yet another situation. No body is
a perfect extrovert or an introvert.

§:06:2 Limitations of the Type-Approach

(b) Democratic (seeks consensus while taking
decisions)

(c) Laissez - faire (Everyone acis on his own; the
leader has no power or control over others)

One serious objection to such views is that changes
of physique often occur for individuals at middle age but
this is not often accompanied by any changes in
personality characteristics.

Type approaches have obvious limitations. Few
people fit into such distinct types easily. Jung himself says



============================================================
--- Page 115 ---
============================================================

214 Educational Psychology

that most persons appear to be atypical or ambiverts.
Even introversion-extroversion now appear to have
aspects and one who is introverted in social activity may
not be equally so in his thinking. It should be noted that
_type approach tries to describe practically useful
distinctions among persons but such distinctions are only
relative. Human personality is too rich and often ‘too
unusual to be described in one or two general types.

5:07 _—«*Trait-Approach to Personality
§:07:1 Meaning of the term ‘Trait’

A personality trait is an enduring and consistent
characteristic of a person that is observed in a wide variety
of situations. Such terms as intelligence, emotional
sensitivity, ascendence, submission, irritability, warm, etc.
are personality traits.

5:07:2 Cattell's Trait Approach to Personality

Caitell has identified 12 independent and4 secondary
traits that describe the complete personality of an
individual. These 16 personality factors are bipolar
(referring to the opposite or extreme degrees). They are :

Genialcshostile, intelligence ~ stupid, emotionally
stable changeable, dominant © submissive, cheerful
& unhappy, sensitive <= hard boiled, thoughtful and
aesthetico boorish and coarse, conscientious
slipshod, cooperatives reserved, vigorous © slack,
hypersensitive ~phiegmatic, friendly < suspicious.

Personality 218

Cattell named these 16 personality traits as ‘Source
traits’, differentiating them from ‘Surface traits’. Surface
traits are easily observable, but the real traits are source
traits which represent a deeper unity than that revealed
by surface traits.

5:07:3 Eysenck’'s Type cum Trait Approach to
Personality

Eysenck provides a hierarchical type approach to
personality combining both the type and trait approaches.
He describes three basic categories of personality at the
top of the hierarchy. ;

Extroversion <> Introversion, Neuroticism ¢ ad stability;
psychotism < normaiity.

These have been ultimately reduced to two
dimensions namely, stable «>» unstable, and
introversion  extroversion. Each of these categories

_ involves certain qualities at the next lower or trait level.

For example, the traits of an introvert would include
such qualities as persistence, rigidity of approach,
subjectivity, etc. These traits in turn are associated
with the next habitual response level. For example,
we may expect an introvert to be persistent in tasks
like problem solving, etc. generally. The last is the
specific response level which applies to specific tasks
in which also the traits involved in the Categories would
be expressed in diverse degrees. Eysenck's approach

_ is hierarchical.with the top indicating types and lower
traits.

§:07:3:01 Characteristics of 'Extroverts’
and ‘Introverts’

Extroverts are described by Eysenck as
“outgoing”, relatively uninhibited, fond of activities
which bring them into contact with other people, not
attracted by solitary pursuits like study, crave for
excitement, are aggressive, unreliable, easy going and
optimistic.

Introverts have the opposite traits such as inward,
highly reserved, shy, like to be aloof, attracted by
solitary pursuits like study, rigid, highly reliable,
persistent, and realistic (in the type approach of Jung
also we have these categories). Eysenck's research
finding also lend support to the existence of extroverts
and introverts.

Approach

§:07:4:01 Usefulness of Trait Approach

i) Trait ratings are useful in the selection and
placement of persons in courses, jobs, etc. -

Personality 217

ii) Any cumulative record listing important
personality traits is of value in the academic
evaluation as well as educational and voca-
tional guidance.

§:07:4:02 Limitations of Trait Approach

Trait approach to personality is criticised on the
following counts:

1) It does not describe how the traits are organised
(or coordinated) within the individual.

2) There may be interaction of different types of fraits
and further any trait has to be appraised according to a
range of situations and circumstances. These are not
accounted for in the trait approach. For example, boys
rated high in “aggressiveness” were not found
aggressive under all types of provocations.

5:08 Freud's Psycho-analytic Theory of
Personality

Freud's theory of personality is based on the following
two fundamental principles :

i) Structure of personality consisis of three
components which function independently and
ai the same time affect each other by their
mutual interactions. They are.: (i) ‘Ie’ the
unconscious mind (ii) ‘Ego’, the conscious mind
which corresponds to the self and (iii) ‘Super
ego’ which gets developed by the parental

EP16



============================================================
--- Page 117 ---
============================================================

218 Educational Psychology

standards and the moral standards of the
society.

ii) Human mind operates at three levels viz. (a)
Conscious (b) Unconscious and (c)
Preconscious or sub-conscious which lies
in between the conscious and unconscious.

4. Id: It is the inborn reservoir of primitive psychic
energy called ‘Libido’ which is completely unconscious
and which demands immediate satisfaction of its
unfulfilled desires (mostly sexual in nature) and instincts,
on the basis of what is known as ‘pleasure principle’
regardless of external reality. Id is the original source of
personality from which ego and Super-ego develop. All
the energy of human behaviour, says Freud, is provided
by inborn Id instincts namely sex and aggression, which
he later spoke of as ‘Life Instincts’ (Eros) and ‘Death
Instincts’ (Thanatos). Personality is moulded by the way
in which a person attempts to resolve the conflicts
between the Id's demands for immediate gratification of
these instincts and Social Constraints.

2. Ego : It develops out of the Id because of the
need of dealing with the real world around the individual.
Ego corresponds to the. ‘self’ and represents reason in
keeping the demands of the Id in check. In fact it
mediates between the unreasonable demands of Id
and the restriction laid down by the Super Ego and
as such it is the executive agency of personality, deciding
what actions are appropriate.

Personality: 219
en

3. Super-Ego : it is the system developed in the
individual by incorporating parental standards and the
moral standards of the society as perceived by the ego.
it is the internalised representation of social and moral
values and it most nearly corresponds to what is known
as ‘conscience’.

To sum up, according to Frued, personality is a kind
of an arena in which what the person wants to do (instinct

- Id) conflicts with what he has learnt he should do
morality as represented by Super Ego) and where.a
reconciliation is made and compromise arrived at ‘by
Ego). The personality of an individual gets shaped in the
following two ways based on how efficiently his / her Ego
is able to balance the Id and Super-Ego.

i). Those who have a strong Ego which succeeds
in balancing the Id and Super-Ego, will have a
healthy and balanced personality.

On the contrary, if a person-has a weak Ego which
struggles to balance the id and Ego, then tension and
conflicts occur frequently which are often managed by
adopting ‘defense mechanisms’. Frequent use of
defense mechanisms itself indicates the danger of the |
onset of maladjustment in the person.

Maladjustment - may gets expressed in two ways. If
the 'Super-Ego’ is powerful than the ‘Id’, the unconscious
desires and instincts get suppressed as a resuit of which
the individual may develop ‘Neurotic behaviour'.

============================================================

220 Educational Psychology

eee entertain

ii) If the id is more dominant than the ‘Ego’, then
the individual may indulge in unlawful activities
and become a delinquent.

; Freud, while attempting to explain personality in
terms of the functioning of the three sub-systems viz. Id,
Ego and Super-Ego, emphasized the importance of the
fulfiiment of the sex instinct. Freud considered sex as life
energy and the fulfilment of sex instinct is one of the
primary needs of man. How far one's sex instinct is satisfied,
determines the status of personality development of an
individual. By knowing one's behaviour expressive of sex
instinct's satisfaction, we can judge at what siage of
personality development he is at.

5:08:1 Freudian Stages of Personality
Development

Freud postulated that since birth an individual passes
through four stages of psychosexual development. The
first stage is called the oral stage which spreads over
the first year of life, during which the child derives pleas-
ure through acts such as sucking, biting, etc. involving
the mouth. The 2nd.and 3rd year of life of the child is
covered by what is called the anal stage since pleasure
centres around this region at that time. This period cor-
responds to the period of toilet training and if anxieties
are felt due to. the method of toilet training, this might
sow the seed for the development of anal syndrome and
marked by excessive conformity and compulsiveness.

Personality 221

coenectenrnaannnmnsitsiemarnemnntaininatnacntaentntntittintnintn Annis t CANN CLL TE ITC ARCA

The anal stage is followed by the phallic stage
(between 4 and 5 years). Here the genitals become the
source of pleasure. itis during this period, the young boy
manifests love towards the mother and views his father
as a competitor for his mother's love. He starts imitating
his father to win his mother's love and in that way he
learns his sex role. Similarly, a girl develops a desire for
ihe father. (Frued called these as oedipus complex and
electra complex). Difficulties in development during this
stage may lead to various forms of sex deviations.

The phallic stage is followed by a period of dormancy
known as the “latency period” which is marked by a
lack of interest in sex.

Coinciding with puberty and adolescence, marked ~
by physical and sexual maturity is the stage known as
the genital stage. This lasts upto adult years. Again
pleasure centres around the genitals which now is meant
to establish stable, jong term sexual relationships.

5:09 Integrated Personality

Self-actualised personality, emotionally and socially
mature individual, well “adjusted personality, integrated
personality are all almost synonymous. Such a person
has realistic assessment of himself, his strength and
weakness, has a stable self-concept involving a higher
level of self-esteem and fewer feelings of inadequacy and
fewer evidences of compensatory behaviour and accepts
himself, leading to himself being accepted by others.


============================================================
--- Page 119 ---
============================================================

222 Educational Psychology

Integrated personality implies harmony between five
important aspects of personality, namely harmony
between one’s abilities and capabilities, harmony among
one's interests, harmony between one's abilities and
interests, harmony between one's self concept and social
constraints, and lastly, between one’s life goals and social
codes of conduct. According to Skinner the
characteristics of an integrated personality are :

- harmonious development of thoughis, feelings
and intentions to activity, affection, sympathy
and a desire to cooperate with others;

- confidence in one's abilities as well as
awareness of one's weakness; ;

Allport points out that an individual with integrated
personality will have two important characteristics.

i) Self extension : Have clear life values and believe
ihem personally and be involved in such values.

ii) Self objectification : Able.to evaluate oneself

without any bias. These two characteristics will jointly .

generate a good philosophy of life. They believe and
practise the dictum ‘Be yourself and accept yourself’.

5:10 Personality Assessment

From time immemorial attempts have been made to
predict the personality pattern of individuals through
astrology, palmistry, physiognomy and phrenology
(predicting personality traits from bumps on the skull),

Personality 223

graphology (handwriting analysis), etc., These are
pseudo-scientific techniques.

To start with, the type approach of classifying people
based on a central theme or characteristic styles of
individuals, Kretchmer, Sheldon, Spranger, Allport and
Vernon tried this ‘type’ of approach. Following Cattell,
personality tests and inventories were developed to
identify and scale the position of the different personality
traits. Scientific and objective techniques of personality
development involve collection of behaviour samples of
various kinds.

Generally before trying to measure personality, it is
necessary to draw up a list of personality traits which are
to form the basis of assessment. Personality scores
should be cautiously interpreted and must be always
supplemented by data from other sources. Only trained
and experienced persons should undertake personality
tests.

5:11 Approaches and Methods of Assessing
Personality

Various methods employed in the assessment of
personality could be grouped under three major heads
as shown below :

5:11:1. Interview Method .

Interviews involve direct interaction between the
tester and the subject and the interviewer arrives at certain
conclusions regarding an individual's standing in certain
personality traits not only from the nature of his answers
to questions asked but also from the way in which the

Personality 225

subject conducts himself during the interview and answer
questions. Interviews may be introductory, fact finding
(or informative), diagnostic or prognostic in nature.
Interviews may also be structured following a standard
pattern or unstructured (in which the interviewee
determines largely what is discussed although a skilled
interviewer may elicit a lot of pertinent information through
his limited questioning).

An interview has a beginning (to establish rapport),
a middle (to elicit information regarding personality traits)
and an end (to terminate the interview on a cordial note
‘by thanking the interviewee). The answers of the
interviewee may be noted down or tape recorded for later
analysis.

§:11:1:01 Limitations of Interview Method |

1. Interviewing is an art and this skill is not present
" in all to the same degree.

2. The problem of subjectivity involved in this
method is its biggest limitation.

3. The interviewer may dominate or humiliate the
interviewee.

4. The interviewer 4may try to thrust his ideas on
the interviewee.

5:11:1:02 Uses of Interview

i) — Interview is the best option to collect information
from children, senior citizens, patients, illiterate
persons and very important persons in the



============================================================
--- Page 121 ---
============================================================

226 Educational Psychology
ene teennenntntnntmrt

society who are very busy in their work
schedules.

ii) Interview is used more for routine activities like
student admission, filling vacant posts, student
counselling, occupational guidance, medical
counselling and judicial enquiry, than for
collecting information for research.

iii) Interview is also used in research, particularly in
historical studies, clinical case studies and survey.

iv) An ably conducted interview is far superior to other
.’ forms of getting reliable information, because :

_a) No one wants to write as much as talking,
especially about themselves. People are less
cautious when talking, compared to writing.

b) As itis possible to clarify the objectives of certain
questions or their meaning, appropriate

responses could be obtained from the -

“ informants.

c) By putting cross questions, the integrity of the
respondents could be confirmed.

d) The informants cannot modify or correct the
responses they have already given to suit the
questions fielded later.

5:11:2 Rating Scales

Ratings are simply the assignment of a numerical
"score that indicates the rater's judgement of the observed

Personality 227
i enn eee
individual's standing on a given particular personality trait.
Generally rating is done on a 5 point scale (very high + 2,
high + 1, average 0, iow - 1 and very low - 2) to indicate
the degree or intensity of the trait present. Rating may
be self-rating in which the subject rates himself and
experimenter rating in which someone eise observes
and rates the subject in a number of personality traits.
Seif-rating is susceptible to distortions due to self-interest

- and so rating by others is more objective and valid.

Factors like personal bias, generosity error (rating all
near the average), inaccuracies due to the ambiguity of
the rating scale and ‘Halo effect’ (our knowledge of an
individual's rating in some personality trait influences our
rating the same individual in another unrelated trait) affect
the reliability and validity of rating. A number of rating
scales of the same individual in a variety of traits may be
combined in the form of a psychegraph or personality
profile, as given in the diagram below :

By comparing the personality profile of an individual
with those of successful men in a particular profession,
we can predict whether the individual will succeed if he
chooses that profession. This helps us in vocational
counselling.

5:11:3 Questionnaire

According to Good & Hatt, “Questionnaire refers
io a device for securing answers to questions by
using an inquiry form which the respondent fills in
himself. In it, various important questions regarding
the topic under investigation or personality traits will
find a place.”

The testee has to note down the answers for the
series of questions found in a printed sheet. From the
nature of the answers given by respondent to the
questionnaire, his personality could be judged very well.
Like questionnaires, personality inventories (usually
statement form) are also used.

_, Personality questionnaires and inventories were
éxtensively used during the World War Il to identify
soldiers with emotional disorders. A few sample questions
from Woodworth’s popular questionnaire, are indicative
of the nature of personality questionnaires.
5:11:3:01 Model Questions in a Question-

naire

1. Do you generally sleep well? Yes / No
2. Do you walk in sleep without your knowing it? Yes / No
3. Do you often feel tired? Yes / No

Personality 229

4. Was your childhood happy? “Yes / No
5. Could you mingle with your classmates

easily, without being shy? Yes / No
6. Do you easily befriend others? Yes / No

7. Are you irritated even for small hindrances? Yes / No
8. Do you often worry what others will think of you?

Yes / No

9. Are you frequently troubled with
feelings of inferiority? Yes / No
10.Do you day-dream a lot? Yes*/ No

Many personality questionnaires and inventories
consisting of such questions have been developed.
Woodworth’s personal data sheet, Allport’s Ascendence
- Submission Reaction Study, Bell's Adjustment Inventory,
The Minnesotta Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI),
Neymann Kohlsted Diagnostic Test, Cattell’s Sixteen
Personality Factor (16 PF) Questionnaire are some of
the standard personality questionnaires which are widely
used. In Minnesotta Inventory 550 statements to evaluate
10 different personality traits are included. In vocational
guidance 16 PF Form B is highly useful.

5:11:3:02 Limitatiéns of Questionnaire

i) lt is rare for any respondent to mark his real
personality characteristics in-a questionnaire. In
general, no one wants to state his / her negative
personality traits.

ii) This method is subjective; the results cannot be
verified. :


============================================================
--- Page 123 ---
============================================================

230 Educational Psychology

iii) If anyone, who does not know about himself fully
gives some information regarding himself, then the
questionnaire will lack construct validity.

5:11:3:03 Merits of Questionnaire

i) It is economical to use under various situations.

ji) - it can be used by teachers in their classrooms
without having any special training.

iii) It can be administered to a number of people at a
time: hence itis less time consuming and also highly
inexpensive.

5:11:4- _ Projective Techniques

Projective techniques strive to get at the fundamental
organisation of personality. Relatively ambiguous and

unstructured stimuli (like vague pictures, inkblots,
incomplete sentences, drawings etc.) presented to the

subject and he is asked to structure them in any way he ~

likes. in doing so the subject quite unknowingly projects
his own desires, hopes, fears, repressed wishes etc. and
thus not only reveals his inner or private world but also
gives indications on the basis of which his total personality
may be assessed. ,

Three Types of Projective Techniques
The three important types of projective techniques
are

i) Perceptive (Like Rorschach Ink blot test where
the subject is to report what he perceives of the
stimulus presented) ;

Personality 231

ji) Apperceptive (Here the subject goes. beyond
what he perceives and offers instead an
elaborate story; eg. TAT)

iii) Productive (these rely on the performance of
the subject like what he draws, what object he
makes of plastic clay, how he plays.a role etc.)

5:11:4:01 Salient Features of Projective Tests

i) Test items of projective tests are quite unfamiliar
to testees. Generally the testees may not have
prior knowledge about how to answer the test
items or what are the expected responses for
these test items. The responses of the testees
are unique, revealing his / her. personality
makeup.

ii) As the test items are presented to the testees,
in the guise of testing the subject's aesthetic
sense and imaginating ability, there is no chance
for the testees to provide fake responses by
hiding their true colours. :

ili) The test items presented are generally
ambiguous, unstructured-and vague-and as such
do not provide aay room for one's. learning,
memory or intellectual! skills.

iv) Projective tests do not demand eloborate
answers from the testees, and hence there is no
need for the skill of explaining, to make one's
ideas clear.


============================================================
--- Page 124 ---
============================================================

232 Educational Psychology

v) Here the interpretation is made not on the basis
of one's response alone but rather in relation to
the total configuration of responses.

5:11:4:02 Rorschach Ink Blot Test

This technique was developed by Harmann
Rorschach the Swiss psychiatrist in 1921.The test
materials consist of 10 cards, each card showing an ink-
blot figure which convey no specific meaning and is of
symmetrical nature on both sides. Out of these 10 cards,
five are coloured and the other five are black and white
with different shades of grey.

A) Conducting the Test
‘The subject is shown the cards in a sequential order,
one at a time. He is asked to say "what he sees in the

picture" or "what the picture reminds him of". The
subject is also to indicate the portions of the ink blot that

suggested his response. Usually there is no time limit for —

the test but some psychologists note down the reaction
time for each card and makes use of that in the final
interpretation.
B) Scoring and Analysis of Responses
Objective scoring of the responses are done based
upon three aspects (i) Location (ii) Determinants
(ili) Contents
Location : lt refers to the particular part of a blot to

which a single response refers. Some of the common
symbols used in this connection are :

Personality 233

W = Whole blot area

D = Large common detail
d = Small common detail
S$ = White space

Other details regarding the size, actual location such
as inside, edge etc. are also marked with different
symbols.

Determinants : By a determinant is meant the
particular aspect of the blot which directs the perceptual
activity. The common determinants are :

M = Movement

F = Form

G = Colour

K = Texture or surface appearances

Content : It refers to the actual meaning of the word.
The common symbols are :

H = Human figures -
A= Anirnal figures

Hd = Human details

Obj = Man made objects
Pi = Plants ’

At = Anatomical detaiis

intellectual activity is mostly indicated by F,W,D, etc.
The externalised emotions are indicated mostly by.C or
combinations like C,F and K responses. The internalised
emotional! life is indicated mostly by M. As the
administration and interpretation is a very complex

process, Rorschach ink-Blot Test could be used only by

a clinical psychologist. The test is highly useful in

psychiatry.

5:11:4:03 Murray Morgan's Thematic
Apperception Test (T.A.T)

This test consists of 20 pictures, each picture
depicting a vague social situation. The subject is required
to describe the situation as he perceives it. He is asked
to describe as to what is happening at the present
moment, as to what has led to the present position, and
as to what it is likely to lead to later on. In short, he is
asked to spin a story with the picture. While constructing
the stories, usually the individual identifies himself with
one of the characters in the picture, thereby projecting
on to them, his own feelings, urges, desifes.and anxie-
ties. The TAT responses are interpreted-by analysing the
recurring themes in the stories; the needs and frustrations
of the hero and the description of the interpersonal relation
of persons in the picture. The responses of the subject
help in understanding him. This test was developed by
Murray and Morgan. For children, a separate test (CAT)
has been developed. ;
5:11:4:04 Situational Tests. _

We can call the situational tests as a kind of
performance tests. The subjects are observed in

situations and they do not Know that they are being
assessed. The tests are camouflaged. A honesty test can

Personality 235

be conducted on young children. For example, in a
vocabulary test, a list of words may be given to the subject,
who is asked to check only the words known to him:-In
the list some fictitious words are aiso included. If asubject
checks fictitious words also he is exposing his dishonesty
by his over statement. A check list of books | have read

can be similarly loaded with fictitious titles:

Situational tests were extensively used during the
second world war.in a programme for the selection of
men for secret duties in army. Harthorne and many others
have divised a number of such situational tests and
performance tests of honesty. Such tests have poor
validity. Situational tests often involve interpersonal
situations. Situational tests may use two.techniques, one
is psychodrama and another is sociedrama..

i. Psychodrama

In psychodrama the individual has fo play a role
spontaneously in a situation. His behaviour is observed
by trained observes. This technique is used to assess
the personality of maladjusted persons. The director or
therapist plays an importapt role in organising situations
in which the subject may express his bottled up emotions.
The. central principle of psychodrama is spontaneity. of
the individual.

il, Sociodrama

_The purpose and emphasis are different in
sociodrama. In psychodrama the subject taking the roie

is involved but sociodrama portrays problems with which
the audience is concerned. It deals with the problems of
the group, its structure and thinking. Many modern
pictures written and directed by creative thinkers are the
examples of sociodrama. They reflect on the screen the
corruption, nepotism, favouritism and redtapism of the
administrative set up.

5:11:4:05 Free Association Tests

Jung developed a free association test and was
further elaborated by Kent and Rosanoff. Free
association tests involve the uttering of a stimulus word
by the tester and the subject responds immediately by
another word. The time taken for response if long may
indicate blocks, needing some more probing. The type of
responses wher analysed will give a clue to personality
characteristics.
