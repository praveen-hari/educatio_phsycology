1:01 | Definition of ‘Psychology’

Etymologically, the word “Psychology” derives its
meaning from the two Greek words ‘osyche’ which
means ‘soul’ and ‘logus’ which means ‘science’ or
‘knowledge’. Thus ‘Psychology’ literally means the
science of the soul. This definition of ‘Psychology’ has

been given up long ago. Today Psychology is defined
as the science of behaviour, the way human beings
behave and the reasons for their behaviour. The term
behaviour should be understood in a broad manner,

to refer not only to observable overt bodily activities

(which alone should be the subject matter of
psychological investigations as per behaviourism) but
also covert and inferred behaviour which could be
designated as mental or conscious activity. As such
psychology is now defined as “a science that
systematically studies and attempts to explain
observable behaviour and its relationship to
unseen ‘mental’ processes (experiences) that go
on inside the organism and to external events in
the environment”. The goals of psychology are
description, explanation, prediction and control of
behaviour including subjective experiences.

By observing events systematically, psychologists
can predict in advance, things that are to follow. For
example if a student gets fail marks in most of the monthly
tests in mathematics, it could be predicted that he will
fail in maths in the annual examinations. The reasons for
poor performance in maths (lack of interest in maths,
lack of motivation, inadequate efforts, negative attitude
towards maths etc.) could also be explained. A maths
teacher with sound knowledge of psychology could plan
for necessary behaviour changes in students so as to
prevent them scoring poor marks in maths.

1:02 Historical Development of Psychology
and its Emergence as a Separat
Discipline Hw
Till 19th century, psychology was studied only as a
branch of philosophy. When we look at the original

_ meaning of the word psychology this will become clear.

The word psychclogy comes from the two Greek words,

‘psyche’ (soul) and ‘logus' (science); so the root meaning

of the word psychology is that it is a science of soul. This
is the traditional approach to the study of psychology.
Traditional psychologists attempted to study the location
of the soul, its nature and its state after the death of the
individual. When we are not sure about the location of
the soul, atlempting to investigate its nature is akin to
the efforts of a blind man, searching for a black cat and
that too in a place where it is not. So the definition of
psychology as the study of soul was given up.

Then it was defined as a science of mind. Mind
functions in three domains viz. Cognitive (thinking),
Affective (feeling) and Conative (willing). A mental act is
different from a physical act. If a piece of iron is placed
near a magnet, the iron moves towards the magnet. This
is a physical act and no, thinking, feeling or willing is
involved on the part of iron or magnet. But on the contrary,
when we place a dish of milk before a cat, the cat moves
towards the milk and drinks it. This is a mental act
because. the cat driven by hunger motive, knowing
(thinking) the white liquid is milk, which it likes (feeling
part) to drink, it actually moves (willing part) towards the

milk. Thus every human act or behaviour emanates from
an internal motive, as the British psychologist Mcdougall
puts it.

According to William Medougall, who proppounded
the "Hormic School of Psychology’ (Purposivism), every
response of man is due to a purpose or inner motive called
“instinet’. Mcdougall criticised behaviourism. He stated
that response occurs, not always due to the occurance
of a stimulus. lt is not necessary that we feel the desire
to eat when we look at sweets. Desire to eat depends
upon the hunger motive. Different motives result in
different responses. According to Mcdougall, it is the
instinct that motivates human behaviour. He further
believes that an emotion is present in any instinctive
activity. Each instinct associated with some emotions
(created by subjective experience one had from his
environment) otherwise known as ‘sentiments’ become
the centre of all activities. Without them no activity is
possible. Though all of us have similar instincts, they get
modified according to one's environment. Our behaviour
depends upon the modification of the instincts or our
sentiments. In other words, sentiments are the motives
of our behaviour and these sentiments may be analysed
into instincts and emotions. Thus instincts and emotions
are the bases of human behaviour according to Hormic
Psychology.

Titchner, who developed the theory of 'Structura-

lism’ believed that mind is the basis of all human actions.
According to him there are three states of mind - cognitive,

OO

affective and conative. The mind was regarded as
consciousness and the ultimate elements of it are
sensation, feelings and images. The nature and siructure
of consciousness can be studied through introspection.
To introspect means to look within. Psychology thus
came to be defined as a science of consciousness.

Behaviour psychologists like J.B.Watson of U.S.A
and others questioned the validity of introspection and
said that psychology should be an objective science. They
bitterly criticised introspection as unreliable. They defined
psychology as a science of behaviour. They tried to define
behaviour in terms of stimulus and response, popularly
known as S-R fromula. For every stimulus, there is a
response. The response to stimulus is behaviour. If you
are pricked with a pin, there is a jerk of the body. ‘Pricking' -

- is the stimulus and the ‘jerk’ is the response or behaviour.

Asimple behaviour consists of the basic unit of behaviour
i.e. S-R. Any complex behaviour can be analysed in terms
of S-R Units chained sequentially. For. behaviourists,
environment is the determinant of one's response or
behaviour and heredity has no influence what so ever.
They also deny Medougall's Theory of Instincis.
Bernard, the behaviougst states that we do not allow
our instincts like fear, sex, acquisition, affiliation etc. to
operate as they are; but we modify them in the midst of
our social environment. Behaviourists also deny any role
for mind in determining our behaviour. They argue that
we talk because of the movement of our tongue and not
because of thinking or functioning of the mind.

6 Educational Psychology

As a revolt against behaviourism and structuralism
Gestalt School of Psychology emerged in 1912.
Gestalists advocated that everything should be viewed
as a whole and studied in its totality. The researches of
Werthemer, Kohler and Koffka contributed a lot to the
development of this school. The German word ‘Gestalt’
refers to ‘configuration’, ‘whole’, or ‘totality’. We
generally perceive the whole and not its parts.

The. ‘whole’ is not the addition of the parts but
something more than that. When we purchase a bicycle,
we only perceive it as a whole cycle and not as spokes,
wheel, saddle, chain, mudguard etc. Sometimes we fail
to notice even some missing parts like bell or lock. So
according to Gestalists perception is unified and
learning is nothing but reorganisation of the field of
perception. Their main areas of investigation are
perception and learning. To perceive an object or event,
apart from our sensation of the object or event, our
previous experiences about them are also called into play.
Things are perceived in the canvas of our background
experience.

Gestalists advocate that human behaviour is based
on one’s perception and perception is influenced by our
past experiences stored in our mind. For them behaviour
is physical (as behaviourists believe) as well as mental
or cognitive. A particular stimulus does not elicit the same
response from every one. People express different
responses as per their previous experiences. On seeing
a snake some may flee due to fear but few / others may
be brave enough to catch it.

Then came the Viennese physician Sigmund Frued
(1856-1939) on the scene with a bang proclaiming the
school of psychology called 'Psycho-analysis’. While
structuralism gave emphasis for the conscious. mind,
psycho - analysis emphasized the role of unconscious
mind in the actions of individuals. Since psycho-analysis
goes deep into the subteranean level of the mind, this is
also known as depth psychology. The other schools of
psychology deal only with surface activities. But psycho-
analysis delves deep into the roots and springs of human
behaviour. The unconscious mind is. the seat of repressed
tendencies and desires, not approved by the society. ‘Sex
plays an important role. According to Frued in the drama
of human existence, sex is the villain of the peace. Frued
holds that early childhood experiences determine the
development of personality. He speaks. of human
personality made up of three major systems - Id
(operating at unconscious level), Ego (operating at
conscious and sub-conscious levels) and Super Ego
(operating at conscious level).

Frued's disciples Adler and Carl Jung broke away
from him and founded their own schools of psychology
viz., ‘Individual Psychology’ and ‘Analytical
Psychology’ respectively. Unlike Frued, _dung stresses
past experiences of the individual. He thinks religion has
a lot of therapeutic value. According to Adler, birth order
of an individual in the family has much influence in
determining one's way of life. a

psychology of Carl Regers, Maslow and others have
also significantly contributed to the growth of psychology
and made it attain today the status of positive behavioural
science. As a pure science, psychology is concerned with
systematic study of behaviour and verification through

experimentation. We can bring psychology under the

category of 'Bio-social science’. The components of
behaviour are :

i)

ii

The conscious experiences of which the
organism is aware of, like that of being hungry
or having pain when injured, etc. and

The unconscious process: (eg.) without any

speciffic reason we get irritated with some
people, become friendly with others etc.

To attain this significant status, many had

1:03 Definition of Educational Psychology
Educational psychology is defined as that branch
of psychology which is concerned with psychological
researches as applied to any or all aspects of
educational processes and practices. It is in relation

to problems liké learning, teaching and training.
Classroom is the laboratory for the educational

psychologists. By applying the principles and laws of ,

psychology in educational situations, educational
psychology tries to solve the different problems faced in
the educative process so as to make it more effective
and efficient (says Kolesnik, the Russian Psychologist).

Psychology is the science of behaviour. Education
is the deliberate process of modifying one’s behaviour
(knowledge, skills and attitude) through a sequence of
systematically planned experiences to acheive the
predetermined goals and objectives (Redden). Therefore
educational! psychology could be considered as the
science of modifying the learner's behaviour so as to
refine his personality and make him an efficient and
responsible citizen.

1:04 Nature of Educational Psychology

Educational psychology has made tremendous

Educational Psychology and LE
Human Growth and Development

advancement and gradually established itself as an

independent study. Most of the educational problems

come under its purview. Child education, diagnostic and
remedial education, education for the gifted and
handicapped, factors affecting learning, principles of
evaluation, etc. bear proof to the claim that educational
psychology is a special field of study. The study of
classroom climate, techniques of behaviour modification,
programmed learning, micro-teaching, software and
hardware approaches, computer assisted instruction are
all the areas developed by the educational psychologists
aimed at improving the interaction between the teacher
and the taught. Advanced techniques of instruction are
through and through psychological by nature. —

1:05 Scope of Educational Psychology

As Blair, Jones and Simpson say, educational
philosophy is primarily concerned with the. question of
what should be done and educational psychology
attempts to answer the question of how it can be done.
Educational psychology for most part is interested in
means rather than ends.

1. Kolesnik mentions the following problems deait
by educational psychologists as forming the scope of
educational psychology :

i) Differences among students
ii) Motivation
iii) Methods of instruction
iv) Evaluation
v) Classroom management



============================================================

============================================================

42 Educational Psychology

vi) Mental health
vii) Character formation

2, H.C. Lindgren opines that Educational
Psychology revolves around the behaviour of the learner
in educational situations and as such it should limit itself
to the teaching - learning process and the educational
environment. Of course the other elemenis involved in
the educational process are the learning experiences
provided and the teacher who organises them. Thus the
basic elements of the content of Educational Psychology
are:

i) The Learner
ii) The Learning Experiences
iii) The Learning process
iv) The Learning situation or environment
v) The Teacher

(i) The Learner : The first focal area of Educational
Psychology is the learner around whom the whole subject-
matter is knitted. The subject-matter of this area acquaints
us with the need of knowing the learner and deals with
the techniques of knowing him well. The innate abilities
and capacities of the individual, individual differences and
their measurement, the overt, covert, conscious and
unconcious behaviour of the learner, the characteristics
of his growth and development at each stage beginning
from childhood to adulthood, are studied in this section
of Educational Psychology.

(li) The Learning Experiences : Educational
Psychology helps in deciding what learning experiences

Educational Psychology and ; 43
Human Growth and Development

snare nents teenies ner CARN

are desirable, at what stage of growth and development
of the learner so that these experiences could be acquired
with great ease and satisfaction. In this area, Educational
Psychology has the subject matter which deals with the
knowledge and principles of psychology facilitating the
selection of desirable learning experiences for the
learner. ,

(iil) The Learning Process : After knowing the
learner and deciding what learning experiences are to
be provided, the emerging problem is to help the learner
in acquiring these experiences with ease and
convenience. Therefore around this pivot, Educational
Psychology deals with the nature of learning and how it
takes place and it contains the topics such as laws,
principles and theories of learning, motivation, transfer
of learning, remembering and forgetting, perceiving,
concept formation, thinking and reasoning process,
problem-solving etc.

(iv) The Learning Situation : This focal area of
Educational Psychology deais with the environmental
factors and learning situations which .come midway
between the learner and the teacher. Topics like
classroom climate and group dynamics, techniques and

~- aids which facilitate learning, learning situation, evaluation

techniques and practices, guidance and counselling etc.
which help in the smooth functioning of the teaching-
learning process. are studied in this section.

(v) The Teacher : The teacher himself is a very
important element in the teaching-learning process.


============================================================

============================================================

14 Educational Psychology

Therefore the Psychology of being a teacher (his
motivations, conflicts, effectiveness, professional growth,
mental health etc.) also included in the scope of
Educational Psychology so as to inspire him to become
a successful teacher and play his role properly in the
process of education.

3. Garrison et. al. recognise the following as major
divisions of educational psychology :

1) The child and his development : The course of

development, nature of intelligence, language and.

thinking, socialisation and its role, etc.

2) Learning and educative process : Learning and
motivation, the learning of skills, knowledge,
understanding and problem-solving, character
development, etc.

3) Evaluating Pupil-Growth : Methods of pupil-
evaluation, studying the individual child, learning
difficulties at school, evaluating the results of instruction,
etc.

4) Guiding the child : Personality intergration,
adjustment problems of the child, pupil-teacher relations,
etc. :

In short, speaking with E.A. Peal, it might be said
that educational psychology broadly deals with the
nature of learning, the growth of human personality,
the differences between individuals and the study of
the person in relation to society.

1:06 Differences Between General and
Educational Psychology

The basic difference between General Psychology
and Educational Psychology appears to be the matter of
focus. General psychology gives a comprehensive view
of human bahaviour. Educational psychology highlights
the behaviour of the learner. Learner, learning
processes and learning situations are the three focal
areas of educational psychology.

The learner has the most important place in the
classroom. One important factor that the teacher should
know about the learner is that there are individual ©
differences among learners. There are gifted, average
and slow learners in the class. The class is generally not
homogeneous but heterogeneous. The next area js
learning process. An effective learning. process is one
where the instruction is individualised. The student's
perception, thinking, reasoning, intelligence, remembering
-all come under learning process. The third area is the
learning situation, that includes the conditions like
physical factors, the tone of the class, attitude and
behaviour of the teacher, etc. In. short, we call this as
classroom climate. Generaily there is diversity in the
classroom and Educational Psychology aims to prepare
the teacher to realize the individual differences among
his pupils and plan accordingly to maximize the achieve-
ment of each individual learner entrusted-to his care.

1:07 Significance of Educational Psychology _

Educational psychology helps the teacher in the
following ways :

A) Contribution to Theory of Education :

1) To understand the development characteristics
of children : To be a successful doctor, one must have
the required professiona! knowledge and skills as well
as the knowledge about the nature of the patient whom
he wants to treat. in the same way, if one wants fo be a
successful teacher, he must know about the science of
behaviour of learners. Children pass through different
stages of development as infancy, childhood and
adolescence. These developmental stages have their own
characteristics. If the prospective teacher knows these
characteristics he can utilise them in imparting instruction
and moulding their behaviour according to the specified
goal of education.

2) To understand the nature of classroom
learning : To instruct effectively in the class, the teacher
must understand the principles of learning and various
approaches to the learning process, problems of learning
and their remedial measures. It also gives the knowledge
of various approaches to understand the learning
process, factors affecting it, and guidance for effective
learning.

3) To understand individual differences and adjust
his teaching to the needs and the requirements of the
class which has a great range. of individual differences.

Educational Psychology and Wy
Hurnan Growth and Development

4) Te understand effective teaching methods :
Classroom teaching is not dependent on any one theory.
It is related and uses several theories of teaching-
learning. The teacher must be acquainted with knowledge
of various theories in order to organise his class-room
teaching. Educational psychology provides us with the
knowledge of different approaches evolved to tackle the
problems of teaching at different age levels.

5) To understand the causes of the problems of
children which occur at different age levels and
successfully solve them. *

6) Knowledge of mental health : Mental health of
the teacher and the taught is very important for efficient
learning. The teacher from the study of psychology can
know the various factors which are responsible for the
mental ill-health and maladjustment. He can prevent
maladjustment in children provided. he is equipped with
the fundamental knowledge of mental hygiene.

7) Curriculum construction : Psychological
principles are used in formulating curriculum for different .
stages. Needs of the pupils, their developmental
characterisiics, learning pattern and needs of the society,
all these are to be incorporated in the curriculum.

8) Measurment of learning . auicome
Psychological tools help the teacher to assess the
learning outcome of the students. He can also. evaluate
his teaching methods and in the light of the performance
of his students can modity his strategy of teaching.

9) Guidance for the education of exceptional
children.

16) Helps to develop positive attitude.
11) Understanding of group dynamics.
B) Contribution to Practice of Education

1) Problem of discipline : Traditional teachers
believed in the dictum “spare the rod and spoil the child”.
But modern teachers who have the knowledge of
educational psychology realise that the use of corporal
punishment is inhumane. Teachers now tackle the
problem of indiscipline by examining the causal factors
leading to them in a more scientific way. The teacher has
changed his attitude from an autocrat to democrat.

2) Use of A.V. aids : Teaching with the use of aids
that affect multiple senses of the learner is more effective
and lasting. Thus the modern teachers resort to the use
of hardware and software approaches in educational
technology to make their teaching more concrete and

_ stable.

3) School and classroom administration has been
psychologised and made participative rather than
dictatorial in nature.

4) Time table : Now subjects are incorporated in
the time-table taking into consideration their difficulty ievel
and fatigue index. No two difficult subjects are taught in
successive periods. ©

5) Co-curricular activities : Teachers used to give

undue importance to the theoretical subjects in schools.

Activities like debate, drama, scouting and games were

supposed to be a wastage of time. Now we give these

activities due importance for the harmonious development
of the personality of children.

6) Use of innovative methods : Several
innovative ideas resulting from research studies in
psychology have been introduced to improve the
teaching-learning process. Activity-centred teaching,
discussion method, micro-teaching, programmed
instruction, and non-graded school classes at the
primary stage are some of the important innovations.

7) Production of text books : We now write text
books taking into consideration the intellectual
development of children, their needs and their interests
at different age levels.

Undoubtedly the study of educational psychology
may be very heipful to equip our prospective teachers
with necessary skills to deal with classroom teaching-
learning problems. Summing up we can say in the words
of W.B. Kolesnik, that “the purpose of educational
psychology is not to give specific, definitive answers
io questions about methods of teaching or
techniques of dealing with children, not to arm the
teacher in advance with pre-packaged. solutions to
the many practical problems that he is likely to
encounter in the classroom. Its purpose, rather, is to

introduce him to psychological theories and research
findings about learners and the learning process, and
to a method of thinking psychologically, that may heip
him answer his own questions, reach his own
conclusions and solve his own problems.

1:08 Meaning of the term ‘Growth’

In the strict sense of terminology the two terms
growth and development have different meanings. The
term ‘growth’ is used purely in the physical sense. It
generally refers to increase in size, length, height and
weight. Changes in the quantitative aspects, which could
be objectively observed and measured, come into the
domain of growth. Growth is one of the components of
the developmental process. In a sense, development in
its quantitative aspect is termed as growth.

1:08:1 Characteristics of ‘Growth’
1) Growth refers to increase caused by becoming
larger and heavier.
2) itis quantitative, additive, and augmental.
3) Itis objectively observable and measurable.
4) Growth does not continue throughout life, it
stops when maturity has been obtained.

5) Growth may or may not bring development. For
example, a child may grow (in terms of weight)
by becoming fat, but this growth may not bring
any functional improvement (qualitative
change) or development. .

Educational Psychology and 24
Human Growth and Development

6) Rate of growth is not uniform. It proceeds more
rapidly in the early years of life but slows down
in the later years of infancy. Again, at puberty,
there is sudden rise in the speed of growth.

7) There exist wide range of individual differences
among children with respect to growth.

8) The rate of growth of different parts of the body
ig different.

1:08 Meaning of the term ‘Developmen?’

‘Development implies overall changes in shape, form
or structure resulting In improved working or functioning.
it indicates the changes in the quality or character rather
than in quantitative aspects. Development is the result of
growth, maturation and learning.

1:09:1 Characteristics of ‘Development’

1. Development.is progressive: series of
changes occur in an orderly, predictable
pattern as a result of maturation and
experience, Development is ‘directional’ and
‘sequeniial’.

2. Development is continuous in all areas of

mental activity. It does not stop with puberty
as in the case of growth.

3. The goal of development is io enable the
individual to adapt to the environment in which
he lives, Le. develop-ment results in improved

’ functioning of the individual.

Educational Psychology

Development is a complex process of
integrating many structures and functions.

Development is of many aspects (eg. physical,
emotional, intellectual, social and moral) and
individual differences are seen in the different
aspecis of development.

Rate of development is not uniform throughout
the life span of an individual. Actually the child
makes advancement during a particular period
of development and takes rest in the next
following period, to consolidate his development.
In advancing therefore, he turnsback and then
moves forward again like a spiral. Thus it could be
said that development is spiral and not linear.

Development is influenced by maturation and
learning.

Development is very much related to one's
environment. Stimulating environment helps an
individual to develop many skills.
Development is based on modelling the
parents, teachers and other elder members.
Since development is qualitative in nature, it
cannot be measured directly. It could be
assessed through keen observation in
behavioural situations.

Development is possible even without growth.

eg. Even short statured people may exhibit.

strong physical functioning.

Development. is continuous in
all areas of mental activity; it
does not stop after pubérty.

Development is complex and
many-sided.

Development describes the
changes in the organism as a
whole and does not list the
changes in parts.

Development is progressive
and sequential

Rate of development is also not
unifom.

Children differ in their level of
development. in different
aspects-physical, social,
emotional and intellectual.

Learning and experience affect
development to a very great
extent. :

Development in one aspect
promotes development in other
aspects (among physical, menial,
social, emotional and moral)
i.e. development is integrative.

1:11. Meaning of Maturation

Maturation is a natural process. It is the growth which .

takes piace within the individual. The maturational
changes are the result of unfolding and ripening of
inherited traits and are relatively independent of activity,
practice or experience. Maturation involves changes that
are associated with normal growth.

1:12 Relationship between Growth,
Development and Maturation

Growth refers to increase in size, length, height and
weight of an organism. Growth is quaniitative in nature
and hence can be objectively observed and measured.
Growth is one of the components of the developmental
process. 'Development' implies overall changes in shape,
form or structure, resulting in improved working or
functioning of the organism. Development is progressive;
series of changes occur in an orderly pattern. As growth

in an organism continues, it reaches a maximum limit

and stops after that. This maximum level of growth is
referred to as ‘Maturation’. Development is a continuous
process, lasting throughout the life of the organism; it
takes place both before and after maturation. Growth and
maturation are largely determined by heredity. On the
other hand environmental influences play a significant
role in determining development. ;

In short, growth and development go hand in hand;
but growth stops after maturation whereas development
continués as long as the organism is alive.

1:13 Dimensions of Human Development

We can distinguish certain aspects of human
development such as physical and physiological (bodily)
development, with which are related locomotor ancd-skil!
developments, congnitive (intellectual) development,
emotional development and social development. These
cul across and continually proceed through the various
stages of development such as infancy, childhood,
adolescence and adulthood. Major aspects of human
growth and development are :

i) Physical Development : Anatomical growth and
Physiological growth are the two components of
Physical Development. Thé growth in the skeleton,
changes in the quality and number of bones, changes in
height, weight etc. constitute Anatomical growth. But the
changes occuring in the interna! organs like heart, lungs,
lever, bladder, kidney, intestine, stomach, brain and
groups of muscles are referred by Physiological growth.
Motor Development refers to the grawih and
development of bodily organs like the limbs. and the
related muscles that activate them so thai functional
efficiency (Manipulative skills) is attained. Thus physical
development consists of both physical and moter
development. Even though there are subtle differences
between physical development and motor development,
they are generally referred to as Physical development
as these two develop jointly and cannot be viewed in
isolation. ;

ii) Intellectual or mental development : It includes
the development of intellectual (also known as cognitive)
powers like thinking and reasoning, imagination,
concentration, creativity, sensation, perception, memory,
association, discrimination and generalisation, etc.

iii) Emotional development : Under this aspect,
starting with the basic instinct or emotion of ‘General
Excitement’, differentiation takes place during the
evolution of primary emotions viz. joy, fear, and anger.
Complex and secondary emotions like disguest, jealousy,
elation, affection, anxiety, sympathy, distress, love,
wonder, awe etc. are learned as the child grows and as
oppurtunities occur. The emotional behaviour is
developed to the point of emotional maturity and balance
of emotions wherein the child learns to control emotion
and express the proper emotion at appropriate situations.
Use of language in also resorted to.

iv) Moral or character development : It includes
the evolution of moral sense to discriminate the right and
wrong and development of character. The individual
develops his ethical and.moral codes. Social development
and moral development are intertwined.

Educational Psychology and 27
Human Growth and Gevelopment

v) Social development : Initailly the child is self-
centred and animalistic in character. Gradually he is
developed into a social being, by learning to behave
according to the rules and norms of society in which he
lives. Due to social development he is able to get along
with others in the society and participate in different soical
activities. He strives for social maturity.

vi) Language Development in Children : Language

- development in children appears to be dramatic: It does,

of course, depend upon physical maturation, like controi
of mouth and tongue. Language development passes
through certain stages though it is rather difficult to
distinguish them clearly. The rate and time taken for
language development exhibits individual differences.
There appears to be specific sequence in language
development. Children use basically the same rules of
grammar during the early stages of learning any language
(Brown's study), and so ianguage abilities appear to
mature just as motor abilities do.

The child speaks its first word normally at about one
year, but even prior to this, it indicates its requirements

’ by making various audible sounds and gestures. These

form the pre-lingual stage, and include. cooing and
erying, babbling and gestures like smiling, moving-head
from side to side, etc. As the child learns to speak,
gestures become less and less, but even ijater they are
used to emphasize words.

By about 18 months, the child, on an average, uses
10 to 12 simple words. By the next 3 or 4.months, its


============================================================
--- Page 22 ---
============================================================

28 Educational Psychology

vocabulary increases rapidly and by 3 years, there isa
sizable vocabulary in the mother tongue, which about 12
years increases to 10,000 words or more. Again, by 2 to
3 years, the child uses words to form sentences, uses
pronouns and plural as well as speaking in past tense.
By 4 to 5 years, sentence formation is considerably
improved; simple rules of grammar are observed. After
54, the school, along with the home, plays a vital role in
language development, contributing te increased
vocabulary, growth in sentence length, greater
comprehension in reading, correctness in pronunciation,
and in developing writing skill. Piaget has pointed out
that in children we can notice a shift from ego-centric
to socialized speech as they grow.

1:14 Development Phases

Of all the mammals, man is the most immature at

birth and needs the longest period of development before —

he is capable of the activities and skills of his species.
This prolonged period of immaturity points to the
necessity of education. The human individual is a
developing organism and progressive sequential changes
take place in an orderly pattern frorn conception illl death.

These developmental changes could be best understood

if we study them in different phases of human life,
otherwise known as ‘developmenial stages’.

1:15 Important Phases of Development

Based on certain. common developmental
characteristics psychologists have classified human life-
span into the following developmentai stages .

Educational Psychology and
Human Growth and Development

| Prenatal stage Germinal Period (First 2 weeks)
(from conception | Embryonic Stage il to Vill week)
to birth) Foetal Stage (IX week to birth)

During the germinal period, the Zygote grows to Va"
Rudiments of bodily organs are formed during the
embryonic stage and heart beat begins by about 8 weeks.
During the Foetal stage, the child attains gradually its
full size and shape. Cell division and differentiation
characterise pre-natal development.

li Postnatal Stages ; *
1. Infancy From birth to 2 years
2. Childhood Early childhood (From 3 to 6 years)

Later childhood (From 7 to 10 years)

3. Pre-Adolescence (From ii to 13 years)

4, Adolescence (From 14 to 17 years: in the strict
sense, upto the onset of puberty)

5. Adulthood Early Adulthood (From 20 to 40
years) ;

6. Middle-age (From 40 to 60 years)

7, Old-age (From 60 years onwards)

Postnatal development involves increase in size and
diversity and complexity of functions. There are certainly
individual differences and so we should not think that
every child will have each stage according to the age
mentioned.

The above 10 stages putforth by Hurlock, may be
telescoped into 4 wider categories - Infancy (From birth
upto 5 years), Childhood (5 to 12 years), Adolescence
(12 to 18/20) and Maturity or Adulthood (after 18/20), as

teachers may generally have to deal only with these broad _

stages of development in their professional work. It will
also be of value to understand the general characteristics
of individuals particularly during infancy, childhood and
adolescence. These three stages are related to primary,
middle and high school levels in education.

1:16 Physical Development from Infancy to
Adolescence

The bodily growth is physical development. Physical
development along with physiological development

appears to be the basic aspect of human development. -

Physical development is rapid during infancy. A new born
infant is about 50 cms in length and 3.5 kg in weight. It
grows another 25 cms by the first year and weight
becomes doubled during the first six months and trebled
in the next six months.

Proportion of head to body changes from % to 1/8
and the lengths of arms and legs increase as the infant
begins using them more and more.

Brain growth is more rapid. The brain has its full
complement of cells even before birth and achieves 80%
of its adult weight by 4 to 6 years. Another 13% is attained
by the age of 8 with complete development at the end of
adolescence.

The internal organs such as digestive organs, iungs,
etc. grow rapidly and reach a balance of effective
coordinated functioning. Sensory development goes
along with such bodily growth and hearing appears well

_ developed at infancy, though coordinated binocular vision

takes more time. in caring for the iniant’s bodily
development, mother’s milk as also the affectionate
atmosphere in which it is given and later nutritious food,
cleanliness, adequate sleep, optimum sensory stimulation
and bodily activities, are all vital.

The physical development secured during the ‘first
three years is strengthened and made more stable during
early childhood. During later childhood bodily
development appears to slow down a bit; body proportion
approximates that of the adult. The stage of adolescence
is again marked by an accelerated rate of physical growth
along with the onset of sexual maturity. This growth is
often uneven, with different rates resulting in clumsiness,
awkwardness in movements and seif-consciousness.
Girls and boys differ regarding physical growth. Man
reaches a greater average level in height and weight than
woman although at the age of 13 girls surpass boys in
average weight since girls attain puberty about a year or
two earlier than boys do.

Motor activities such as head control, movement of
eyes, sitting, standing, walking, running, climbing {alt
these are referred as locomotor skills) and
manipulative skills like ‘handling of objects with
dexterity’, ‘eye-hand co-ordination’, precision of control,

speed of arm movement, arm steadiness, aiming, etc.
are important for personal and educational growth. The
child makes contact with the external world only through
motor development which is closely related to intellectual,
emotional and social development:

There are individual differences in the growth and
development. An early discovery of the problems and
deviations in physical development can help the teachers
to give proper guidance in promoting adjustments among
children. Proper physical and motor development promote
self-help and competence in children.

1:17 Intellectual Development from Infancy to
Adolescence

Intellectual development is also referred to as
cognitive development. Intellectual development refers
to the gradual growth in what are called cognitive abilities
(ability to attend, to perceive, to discover, to recognise,
ic imagine, to judge, to conceptualise, to remember, to
learn, to reason, to take decisions, to solve problems and
to indulge in meaningful speech) and also to consequent
growth in knowledge and adjustment to environment.
Cognitive development is influenced by nutritional,
emotional and social factors.

The mental powers of the new born infant are
immature and undeveloped; its brain centres are still

maturing and its knowledge at birth is practically nil. But —

even early, observers can notice individual differences in
the mental powers of infants due to hereditary differences.

Educational Psychology and 33
Human Growth and Development

The infant's first intellectual response is to stimuli from
the outside world. Its intellectual activities broaden as its
power of imagery grow and powers of retention of past
sensory experiences and their recall develop. Imagination
which comes to the forefrant by about the age of three,
expresses itself through play activities and it also serves
as a means of intellectual development. Language
{mother tongue) helps in preserving as well as fostering
intellectual growth which continues fo accelerate as
children develop the ability to judge, to reason and to
solve problems, starting from the concrete level and going
iowards the abstract. Creativity heips in divergent
thinking, leading to novel intellectual products and
practices. Psychologists like Jean Plagel point oul that
child’s cognitive processes are not abridged or
simplified versions of adult processes but are
qualitatively different, though certain cormmoén invariants
are also there. Broadly speaking, cognitive development

__ of children can be fosiered by a stimulating home and

school environment with a lot of scope for free self activity
and opportunities for varied senscry experiences.

1:18 Social Development from Infancy to
Adolescence,

Social development takes place gradually. Being a
social person is not innate; it must be learned. The new
born infant exhibits little or no social activity. It is
concerned with its satisfaction of bodily needs. At birth it
ig non-gregarious and the ‘l-feeling’ alone appears to
be dominant. Even about 4 weeks, the infant stares at

Epa

ee
faces closely and a few weeks later wants to be picked
up. The first significant attachment behaviour of the infant
is recognition of its mother and graduaily this social
interaction circle widens to include other members of the
family and the ‘we-feeling’ emerges.

The early play activities of very young children is
solitary play; later on it becomes parailel play (each child
in a group playing in its own way). Oniy by about the age
of two, the child shows a desire to cooperate with others
in group plays. Thus early childhood is pre-gang stage
of social development but childhood is the gang stage,
‘when playmates have an active role in accelerating social
development. No sex differences is felt at this stage. The
child is assimilating socializing experiences through direct
imitation of the patterns of other children and by
spontaneous reaction to things which they do or to
situations they create. Social behaviours that are
developed during childhood are rivalry, aggression, co-
operation, sympathy, social approval and certain social
prejudices imbibed from adults. Notions of proper and
improper social behaviour gradually develop.

Later childhood (8-12) is marked by maximum social
adjustment in the changeable and variable social world
marking a level of pseudo maturity. Though the child
stays away from its home now a considerable amount of
time, the importance of paternal affection continues to
be undiminished.

Adolescence is marked by sex consciousness in
social relations. Adolescents of the different sexes try to

Educational Psychology and

Human Growth and Development 35
mutually attract each other. But relations between boys
and girls are not very well defined during early
adolescences resulting in a lot of embarrassment in the
behaviour of youth. Popularity or unpopularity play a vital
part in adolescent adjustment. Self-assertiveness, social
insight, social competence, social discrimination or
snobbishness are all seen emerging during later
adolescence and ultimately adult social patterns develop.
Adolescent gangs are also powerful factors in
socialisation and peer group culture is dominant. This
may sometimes lead to antisocial or delinquent behaviour,
if not guided and properly sublimated. .

Developmenta! psychologists have listed certain
social characieristics of children at different stages of
development. Pre-school children have one or two friends
but change their friends easily as they are socially flexible.
Play groups at this stage are small and loosely organised.
Quarrels are frequent but are of short duration and quickly
forgotten. Dramatic play is frequent and awareness of
sex roles begins at this stage.

Primary class children appear to be more selective
in their choice of friends and like organised. games;
quarrels are still frequent and words are more often used
than physical aggression. Competition and. boasting are
often seen and boys and girls show different interests,
both in werk and play.

During elementary grades, the gang influence
becomes powerful. Interests of boys and girls become
more divergent. Team games are more popular.

During adolescence, peer group dominance
becomes more pronounced and concern for opposite sex
increases. At the end of adolescence, adult social patterns
come out. a .

4-49 Emotional Development from infancy to
Adolescence

The‘new born infant has a single generalised
emotional response of excitement only and out of this
gradually evolves increasing differentiated patterns of
emotional expression over the course of development.
in about 6 months, the child can express the three primary
emotions as described by Watson : :

- thwarting of appetites and restricting the free
bodily movements of the infant naturally makes
itangry;

- loud, harsh sound and sudden loss of support
evokes fear;

- Satisfaction of appetites, petting and fondling
produces love and joy.

Social factors, imitation and learning lead io a variety
of emotional reactions and expressions and by early
childhood most of the common emotions-affection,
elation, joy, anger, disgust, jealousy, fear, sympathy, etc.
are clearly discernible.

Pre-school children, because of their immaturity and
lack of control, tend to express their emotioris freely and
openly. Angry outbursts, which are seen frequently, are

Educational Psychology and a7
Human Growth and Develapment

caused by fatigue, hunger or needless adult interference.
As they are offen exposed to many strange situations,
they exhibit many fears and thelr imagination produces a
variety of irrational fears also in such children. Jeaiousy
ig equally common at this stage. Primary grade children
(between 6 to 9 years) are often alert to the feelings of
others; but they often hurt the feelings of other children.
They are very sensitive to criticism and need praise and
recognition. After the age of 9, conflict between group
codes of the peers and the adult rules often cause
emotional difficulties. :

Se

At the end of infancy, changes occur in the mode of
expression of emotional reaction. For example smail
infants express their emotion of anger through crying. At
the age 3, on becoming angry, infants start beating or
biting others. At the age of 4, they show their anger by
insubordination. At the age of 6. they vent their anger
through verbal abuses. Such patterns of change in
emotional reactions exhibited by children could be noticed
in other emotions aiso.

According to Frued there seems to be a twin faceted
emotional behaviour of individuals during infancy ard
early childhood. Male hildren display much affection
towards their mother. Though they have affection towards
their father, they also have jealousy and hatred towards
him, as they feel father has more concessions with the
mother, whom they love most (This is known as Oedipus
complex) Similarly in girls appear the opposing emotions
of love and hatred simullanecusly towards thelr mother.

(This is known as Electra complex). If such ernotional
complexes are intense and persist for long, they may
affect the personality characteristics of the individuals
later on.

1:20 Stages of Moral Development in Children

Psychologists mention 4 stages in the moral
development in children. In the first stage, known as
‘Prudential Stage’ children’s behaviour is regulated by
means of pleasure and pain. Children learn those
behaviours that are rewarded and avoid these which are
punished. The second stage is the ‘Authoritarian Stage’
in which children follow the directions of his elders like
parents and teachers who have dominating influence over
the children. The third one is the ‘Social stage’ in which
children’s behaviour is governed by the social acceptance
or rejection. Children iry to behave in conformity with
social expectations. The level of moral development in
most of us get stagnated at this stage. The highest stage
of moral development is the ‘Personal Stage’ in which
an individual's behaviour is influenced by his conviction
of high morals and ethics. Even if the whole society
opposes him he will be steadfast in his action, if he thinks
his action is highly ethical i.e. he will be courageous in
his convictions.

1:20:1 Jean Piaget's Stages

Jean Piaget and Laurence Kohiberg have put
forward a development theory of morality. Piaget
‘distinguishes between ‘moral realism’ and ‘moral

Educational Psychology and 29
Human Growth and Development

relativism’. Young children are moral realists who
interpret moral rules and look at the material side of the
actions and their magnitude, ignoring the intentions of
the acts. Suppose a child is asked to pass moral
judgements on two acts. In the first case a child breaks
two tea cups while attempting to reach stealthily the
sweets kept over the cup board and in the second case a
servant maid breaks 4 tea cups due to carelessness while
serving tea to the visiting guests. The child will hold the
servant maid as more guilty than the stealing child
because of the magnitude of the act i.e. breaking ‘more
number of cups.

Only by about 11-12 years, do children become
capable of moral relativism. They are now capable to
decentre and think of several qualities at once and they
have overcome their ego centricism by becoming aware
that other people may have different points of view.

Consequently they take into account motives and

circumstances in making moral judgements. After the age
of 12 children behave in a conciliatory and forgiving way.

1:20:2 Kohlberg's Stages

& :
Kohlberg’s theory of moral development is based on

Piaget’s general theory of cognitive development
(Kohlberg believes that moral development, like cognitive
growth takes place through ‘assimilation’ and
‘accommodation’) He lay emphasis on the significance
of looking at things from other's point of view (role taking).
There are three levels of moral development.

|
4


============================================================
--- Page 28 ---
============================================================

49 Educational Psychology

In level 1, the preconventional level, Kohlberg
regards it is based on the desire to avoid punishment
and gain rewards. At level 1 there is no Internalization of
moral standards. At level 2, the conventional level,
although the chlid identifies with his parents and conforms
to what they regard as right and wrong, it is the motive to
conform rather than ethical standards that have been
internalized. It is only at level 3, ihe postconventional
level, that moral judgement is rational and internalized
and that conduct is controlled by an internalized ethical
code and is relatively independent of the approval or
castigation of others. At this level, moral conflict is
resolved in terms of broad ethical principles, and violating
these principles results in guilt and self-condemnation.

Like Plaget, Kohlberg also speaks of maturation as
the basis of moral growth; but mere maturation may not
help one to reach the higher levels of morality. The
individual must undergo life experiences that specifically
“confront him with more complex moral dilemmas and
with the realities of the social system in which he lives”.
These points are of relevance in planning a course of
moral education. Kohlberg advocates the existence of
some basic or universal moral values as all norma!
children everywhere go through the same stages of
cognitive development and interact socially in essentially
the same ways.

1:21 Period of Adolescence

The word ‘adolescence’ comes from the Latin verb

Educational Psychology and at
Human Growth and Development

‘adolescere’ which means ‘to grow’. So the essence of
the word adolescence is growth and it is in this sense
that adolescence represents a period of intensive growth
and change, in nearly all aspects of child's physical,
mental, social and emotional life.

Adolescence begins with the onset of puberty and
lasts tl ihe beginning of adulthood (12+ to 18/20). Several
physiological and psychological changes occur during this
period. The spurt in growth during adolescence starts with
the secretion of hormones from the ovaries, testes and
adrenal glands Into the blood stream and tissues.
According to Cole, adolescence is a period of growth in
ail systems of the body. In the course of a few years the
individual undergoes changes both in size and in his
internal body chemistry. The rapidity, variety and force of
these developments are amazing. The changes are so
extensive that some people call this as second birth.
Stanley Hail called this period as "period of storm and
stress”, a time when the individual is erratic, unstable
and unpredictable. But modern researches and
interpretations have made much of Hall's views obsolete. —
Brickson’s epigenetic model and self-concept
development have added new dimensions to the
interpretation of adolescence.

1:22. Special Characteristics of Adolescents

i) Rapid perplexing physical changes : Rapid
physical changes in physical appearance, development
of internal organs, functioning of sex organs facilitating

--- Page 29 ---
============================================================

42 Educational Psychology
ee
the individual to acquire parent hood, physical strength
reaching its zenith etc. take place during adolescence.

ii) Heightend Self-consciousness : Adolescents
are highly anxious about the physical changes that take
place in them and try to present themselves most
attractive in all possible ways (hence referred to as an
age of self-decoration). They attempt to attract others
through their dresses, make-up, manner of talking,
walking etc.

iii) Intensification of sex-urge : Sex consciousness
becomes too intense at this time. Most of the adolescents’
problems are concerned with the sudden functioning of
their glands, secretion of sex hormones and the
awakening of the strong sex instinct.

iv) Craving for Independence : The adolescent is
on the boundary line demareating childhood from
adulthood. He is typically a person who needs security,
guidance and support from parents like a child and at the
same time he has independent views of his own; wishes
to have economic self-dependence and autonomy in his
functioning. He starts reacting strongly when parents and
elders treat him as a child. He tries to assert himself and
displays dissent to being controlled by powerful others.
He possesses a strange mixture of dependence and
independence which creates conflicting situations and
problems for him.

v) Peer - group relationship : Peer group
relationship plays a substantial role in the life of an

Educational Psychology and 43
Human Growth and Development .

adolescent. He gets distanced form his parents and elders
and spends much of his time with the members of his
peer group. He values the ideals of the group and
develops a sense of loyalty towards it; he is now directed
by the standard and norms of his peer group. When there
is a conflict between the demands of social and cultural
norms of adults and those of the peer groups, he gets
frustrated, which may at times lead to his maladjusted
behaviour. The group behaviour of adolescents in
schools/coileges is on any one of the two lines:
a) fun and joy through activities like singing,
dancing, playing, seeing movies, etc.
b) indulging in destructive activities like noisy
protests, strike, teasing others, etc.

vi) Idealism vs. Realism : A typical feature of

- adolescents lies in their interest in ideals. But in this

search of idealism they go away from realism. Lack of
experience makes him somewhat unrealistic. He tends
to accept the impossible. (eg. insisting that everyone
should come in the queue to receive their ration is
laudable; but denying exemption for the sick and the aged
from this rule reflects one's unrealistic attitude). When it
is not attainable he becomes disturbed and unreasonable.

vii) Vocational Choice and Need of Self-support :
The period of adolescence requires from the individuals
to decide about their vocations. Emotional instability, lack
of experience and maturity prove to be obstacles in
making the right choice. Moreover their interests,



============================================================
--- Page 30 ---
============================================================

B4 Educational Psychology

aptitudes and abilities, make them puzzled with respect
to exercising their vocational choice. in the absence of
proper guidance they may turn out to be misguided youth
indulging in anti-social activities.

vill) Aspiring for Leadership : Adolescents are
stimulated by idealism and aspire for democratic
leadership. They are unselfish, responsible and respect
other's points of view. These quailties of leadership are
preseni in them in a natural way which could be further
developed by entrusting to them the responsibility for
organising various ieam events like games, excursion,
debates, cultural competitions etc. within the school as
well as between schools, under the guidance of teachers.

1:23 Problerns of Adolescents

Adolescence is a period of stress and strain. All are
not able to smoothly cross over this stormy period of life.
important problems of adolescence are discussed below :

4:23:1 identity Crisis

Though an adolescent needs security, guidance and
economic support from his parents, still he tries to
establish to others that he has independent views,
maturity of opinion and relies on self-support like adult.
Thus his conflicting stances lead him to self-confusion
about his own identity @vhether he is a child or an adult).
During later adolescence, he slowly tries to come out of
this confusion about his self identity and develops his
own norms of behaviour and expectations; develops his
abilities and values. ;

Educational Psychology and 45
Human Growth and Development

1:23:2 Generation Gap

in today's changed world, there is a large gap
between the view points of the elders and youngsters of
this generation. Progress in science and technology and
the consequent increase in the life comforts of our
adolescents have brought in a sea change in ihe goals,
actions, ideals, interests, values and expectations of our
youngsters which has alienated them from the present
day elders. This alienation is termed as generation gap
which psychologists consider as responsible for the
conflicts between the adolescents and their eldels at
home as weil as in the society at large [(eg.) youngsters
want to pay respect to others, not on the basis of age or
seniority but due to efficiency, ability and performance
which is not agreeable to elders].

Rapid technological changes witnessed in our society
coupled with the craze for independence have
unfortunately contributed a lot to the denigration of our
age old customs, cultural traditions and values in the
midst of youngsters. Many a social institution like family
and school has undergone changes in their structure and
functioning, resulting in jncreased opportunities for our
adolescents to go astray and induige in smoking; drinking,
drugging, developing liberal sexuai relations etc.

1:23:33 Negative and Non-Conformist Attitude

In their attempt fo assert their individuality,
adolescents, oppose all the elders, particularly those who
control them. They question every social tradition and do


============================================================
--- Page 31 ---
============================================================

46 Educational Psychology

not meekly conform to ail social customs, which create
problems in their social adjustment.

1:23:4 Domination of Sexual Urge

The foremost problem in adolescence is the
excitement created due to the domination of sexual urge,
which leads to distraction and wastage of energy of ihe
youths.

1:23:5 Hesitation and Confusion in Selecting
a Vocation

As they are not sure about their own potentials,
interesis, abilities and aptitudes and also proper guidance
is not available in knowing about different occupations,
their nature and scope, requisite entry qualifications and
skills etc. adolescents appear to be highly confused in
their selection and preparation for future career.

1:23:6 Emotional Swings

Adolescents are highly restless, emotionally
perturbed and moody; without any proper reason, at one
time they appear to be elated and joyous and the next
moment highly depressed. Unfulfilled desires and

longings make them aggressive. As they aspire for those ©

beyond. their abilities and potentials, easily they get
frustrated. Adolescence is said to be a stage of
“ignorance of one’s practical world”.

1:23:7 Aspiring for Autonomy

Adolescents ardently wish to be liberated from
parental control and function independently. They feel

they are grown up and mature and also expect due
recognition from others. They display dissent to being
controlled or supervised. The greatest social problem of
adolescents is that they start questioning thelr parents,
become disobedient and protest strongly when being
controlled. In severe cases, they stay away from their
family or run away from the home.

1:23:38: Peer Group Dominance

Adolescents get distanced from their parents and
elders and spend much of their.time with the agemates
of their peer group. They value the ideals of ihe peer
group and develop a sense of loyalty towards it. Their
behaviour is directed by the standard and norms of the
peer group. in the company of bad friends, adolescents
derail in their social behaviour, at times leading to
delinquency. Hence parents are required to help their

- adolescent children in selecting their friends and

channelise the energy of the peer group in constructive
and creative activities.

1:24 Helping the Adolescents to Overcome
their Problems

The needs of the adolescents have to be satisfied
and their problems are to be realised in a proper way in
order to help them in growing and developing properly.
This difficult task requires the joint efforts of parents and
teachers. Below are some suggestions in this regard:


============================================================

============================================================

48 Educational Psychology

i) Te have the proper knowledge of adolescent's
psychology : Adolescence is the bridge between
childhood and adulthood. it is essential to have the
knowledge of the adolescent's psychology in order to
understand them and their problerns. They shouid be
treated sympathetically and helped to solve their problems
by offering proper guidance. They should be helped in
resolving their conflicts and overcoming frustrations.

ii) Providing sultable environment for proper
growth : Adolescence is the period when maximum
growth and development takes piace. To optimize this
development, sullabie environment should be provided
by the parents and teachers at home as well as in schools.
Adolescents must be provided with balanced diet; they
must be given knowledge of health and personal hygiene,
cleanliness, various diseases and their prevention etc.
to keep them fit and agile. Adequate provision for physical
exercise, games and recreations should be made in the
school curriculum and facilities made available. Making
use of thelr interests, curricular and co-curricular
experiences are to be planned and arranged.

il) Rendering proper sex education : Sex plays
dominant role during adolescence. As adolescents are
frightened by nocturnal emission/menstruation, they
_ should be provided with proper sex information and
education; or otherwise they may become victims of
exploitation by yellow journals, pseudo sexologists and
advertising agencies which provide half-backed
information on sex.

Educational Psychology and 49
Human Growth and Development

iv) Proper dealing with adolescents :

a) Parents and teachers should recognize the
importance of the peer group on modifying
adolescents’ behaviour.

b) Elders should not atiempt to thrust their views
and decisions on the adolescents; instead they
should try to convince them by their rational
arguments.

c) As adolescents crave for recognition, teachers
and parents should invite their views and ideas
and give due consideration and recognition.

d) As adolescents wish for social recognition,
rights and responsibilities, opportunities are to
be provided for them to carry out team work,
undertake field trips, participate in N.C.C.
Camps, fine arts etc; organise ‘school
celebrations and exhibitions and so on.

@) Teachers and parents should serve themselves
as role models for adolescents in the religious
and moral spheres, instead of criticising /
reprimanding them.

v) Training of emotions and satisfaction of
emotional needs : Adolescent youths are surcharged
with emotions, highly inflammable and restless. Their
emotions can be aroused with a slight provocation.
Political parties and opportunist leaders can easily befoo!
them and instigate them to indulge in strike and damage

public properties. Therefore there is a strong need for
proper emotional education. Their emotions should be
properly trained and their emotional energies should be
diverted towards constructive ends. Provision in schools
for students’ self-government, fine arts association, radio-
club, science club, science exhibition etc. provide
opportunities for the youths to develop their organising
and leadership skills. Similarly participation in scouts,
N.C.G. social and community service, sports and games,
competitions, quiz etc. offer opportunities to develop their
abilities and interests.

vi) To take care of the special interests of the
adolescents : A great care should be taken to locate the
special interests and aptitudes of adolescents. According
to their interests and aptitudes they should be provided
with learning experiences and opportunities for
participation in co-curricular activities.

Their thirst for curiosity, wandering and adventure
should be quenched through excursion, N.C.C,
mountaineering, scientific exploration etc. Their love for
humanity and ideals should be utilised in rendering social
and community services like blood donation camps,
functional literary movements etc. in the neighbourhood
and distressed areas so as to make them constantly busy
and their mind pre-occupied with healthy and constructive
ideas.

vii} Providing Religious and Moral Education :
Opportunities should be provided for adolescents to

Educational Psychology and 52°
Human Grewth and Development

discuss religious and moral issues rationally. Emphasis
should be shifted from rituals to ideals, by facilitating a

comparative study of the tenets of some important worid

réligions. By nature, adolescents are hero worshippers.
{f we provide them with selected examples of saints and
prophets, religious and social reformers and great leaders
who sacrificed their lives in our struggle for independence,
iheir interests can be better served as they will imbibe

~~ many of the ideals of their heroes.

vill) Provision for Vocational Education «, As
adolescents aspire for economic self-dependence, they

_ should be provided with proper vocational guidance to

take up jobs during their holidays and vacations.
Vocational oriented curriculum at the secondary level will
be of great help in grooming the adolescents.

ix) Arranging Guidance Service : Adolescents are
at the cross-roads of life. Lack of guidance creates
feelings of insecurity ahd restlessness in them. Hence in
all high schools and colleges, guidance cells should be
established and made functional, offering educational,
vocational and personal guidances to our students ard
youths. *

1:25 Developmental Tasks

Every culture expects its members to master certain
essential skills and acquire certain appropriate behaviour
patterns at various ages during the life span. These tasks,
skills and behaviour pattern are essential to personal and
social adjustment at those ages and each cultural group



============================================================
--- Page 34 ---
============================================================

52 Educational Psychology
ee
expects its members to aquire these. For example all
children are expected to master the 3 R's (reading, writing
and counting) during their early childhood years.
Heavinghurst has labelled these as “Developmental
tasks”. Developmental task is “a task which arises at
a period in the life of an individual, successful
achievement of which leads to his happiness and
success with later tasks, while failure leads to
unhappiness and difficulty with later tasks”.
Developmental tasks are different for different
developmental periods of an individual namely, childhood,
adolescence, adulthood, middle age and old age. Some
developmental tasks arise purely from maturation (eg.
learning to walk), others arise from socio-economic
pressures (eg. learning to read) and a few may grow out
of personal values and aspirations of the individual
(eg. choosing some vocation). In most cases
developmental tasks arise from these forces working
together. Schools should help students to deal with the
tasks appropriate to their level of development.

The ages at which the social group expecis iis
members to master the developmental tasks of that age
are called critical ages. During such critical periods,
maturational factors predispose the individual to acquire
these patterns of behaviour which facilitate adjustment
to the society and external world. As values undergo
changes in society, some of the old accepted
developmental tasks get eliminated and may be replaced
by new tasks or their relataive importance may get
lessened. ;

Educational Psychology and 53
Human Growth and Development

1:25:71 Uses of the Knowledge of Developmental
Tasks

i) Developmental tasks are of value to the
individual in enabling him to know what is
expected of him by society at.a particular age.

ii) Parents who are aware of such developmental
tasks may teach them to their children so that
the children. may not experience failure and
unhappiness later.

iii) The developmental tasks show the individual
what lies ahead and what he will be expected
to do when he reaches the next stage of
development and this will eliminate much of the
difficulty and emotional stress in later
adjustment. For example, if.adolescents are
aware of the probelms and tasks that lie ahead,
they could be better prepared for them.

lf parents and teachers know the dévelopmental
tasks, then they can provide the necessary experiences
and training to children and ensure the children to behave
as per the expectations of the society and lead a
successful life. If any ghild is found to lay behind in
developmental tasks at a particular period, then it can be
provided with special education or training. For example,
we could often hear in our countryside old iadies and
grand mothers enquiring their relatives, “Has your child
completed two years of age? Is he talking now?” etc.

- This is done precisely for the purpose of knowing the

nee
developmental trend of the child. if a two year old child is
not talking, then it points out to the necessity of referring
the child to a doctor and procure the help of a speech
therapist.

1:25:2 Harms due to Insistence of Develop-
mental Tasks

i) Inappropriate expeciations : Developmental

norms may not hold good in the case of late or -

slow developing children like the retarded.
Further, showing disappointment when a
particular behaviour pattern does not show
itself in a child at the normally expected time
may result in feelings of inferiority and
consequent further retardation in the child.

ii) Among the developmental tasks, omitting a few
earlier one's and attempting to develop the next
higher. tasks in-children may prove to be
injurious for the proper development of the
child. For example, in some schools in their
over enthusiasm, in the middle of X1 Standard
without finishing the entire syllabus meant for
that class, they start teaching the syllabus of
XH Standard. This is highly injurious to the
proper intellectual development of children.

iii) When an individual passes from one
developmental stage to the next higher one,
his unique experiences and the resulting
frustration may sometimes prove to be harmful.

For example if a 25 year old lady does not
agree to marry or determines to remain
unmarried, then our society talks il of her,
considers her suffering from defects or illness.
This is because the developmental norm in our
society for a 25 year old girl is to get married.
This kind of criticism may lead to conflicts and
frustrations in the lady and her life may be
shattered.

1:26 Developmental Tasks for the Various
Stages of Development ey
Havinghurst has listed the following developmental
tasks for the various stages of development. It-has to be
remembered that some of these may not be pertinent to

our culture system and life values, as such tasks have a

cultural bias. : ;

The primary aim of education is to provide

- experiences and training to children so as to equip them.

with necessary basic skills and knowledge, due to their
age, thereby enabling them to lead a successful life. This
gigantic task is undertaken at different stages of
education viz. elementary, secondary, higher secondary
and higher education levels. As the rate of learning of an
individual is in accordance with his physical and

intellectual development, itis the duty of the school to
arrange for adequate opportunities for the child and
motivate him to acquire the requisite knowledge and basic

skills at every stage of education. Educationists should:

take special care in designing the school curriculum for
different classes ensuring it to be broadbased and
capable of providing variety of experiences. through
curricular and co-curricular activities. The knoweldge of
developmental tasks enable the lead players in education
viz. parents and teachers to understand the complexities
involved in the teaching - learning process and develop
that of an allround personality in the child. This make
them realise the importance of children participating in
sports and games, physical exercises and various co-
curricular activities as well as the need for cultivating
personal health and hygiene.
