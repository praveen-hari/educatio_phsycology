2:00 Introduction

In this unit, Meaning and Definition of the mental
process ‘attending’, its nature, Types of attention,
Determinants of attention, Ways and means of securing
better attention in the class, Meaning of sensation and
perception and the factors which affect perception, Laws
of perception, Meaning of memory, Kinds of memory,
Factors affecting memory, signs of Good memory and
Techniques of promoting better memory are to be
discussed.

2:01 Meaning of Attention

Modern psychologists, who believe in the integrated
functioning of the mind, do not consider ‘attention’ as an
independent faculty or unique power of mind. As itis a
process or an activity of the mind, it is better to speak of
‘attending’ rather than ‘attention’. If we are clear that what
we are speaking of, is an ongoing process. or activity,
then it is alright to*use either of these terms
synonymously, for the sake of easy expression and
convention. Whenever we are awake or conscious, we
seem to be attending to something or other, as the mind
when active, has to attend on some stimulus. As William
James pointed out, field of attention and consciousness
are not identical; only a few contents in the field of our
consciousness are selected and attended to. Others

i
though experienced by us, may not be clearly and
distinctly felt by us. Figuratively, we can speak of a margin
(fringe) and focus (central area of clearness) in our field
of consciousness. The terms ‘Figure’ and ‘Ground’ used
by Gestalt Psychologists almost correspond to the focus
and margin respectively. Stimuli that are attended to are
in the focus while others lie in the margin of our conscious
field. The focus and margin alternate; i.e. the stimulus
now in focus may drift to the margin and may be replaced
by some other stimulus, which was earlier in the margin.

2:01:1 Definition of Attention —

‘Attending’ can be defined as the mental activity of
focusing on certain aspects of one’s current experiences
and ignoring others. Attending may be considered as a

kind of mental set which predisposes the individual to.

concentrate upon one and screen out others. Such
attentive sets involve not only mental selectivity but
receptor adjustment (focusing our eyes oF turning our
head), general postural adjustment (leaning forward),
muscle tensions, etc. As such there appears to be
affective and conative aspects to the cognitive activity
attending. MeDougall defines ‘attending’ as ‘striving to
cognize’. Attention increases one’s efficiency and is vital
for acquisition of skills. It is also an aid to remembering
and recall.

2:02 ‘Types of Attention
Attention are of two kinds.

i. Voluntary or Volitional Attention
ii. Involuntary or Non-Volitional Attention

Attention, Perception and Memory 65

Involuntary attention is spontaneous, free, natural
and passive. Not much effort is needed for this type of
attention. Attention of young chiidren is of this nature.

This type of attention invoives some effort or will,
Some times we have to force ourselves to attend to
objects or events in which we lack interest. In such cases,
we take efforts to set our attention on the stimulus in
question. Thus we can say voluntary attention is
intentional. .

Sometimes effort is required.to initiate or start
attending, which once it has got a start through effort,
then goes on effortlessly. Far example, it may require
effort on our part to. start reading a new book. Once
started reading, we may be absorbed in reading, if the
book is well written. This type of attention triggered by
effort, is known as ‘implicit Volitional Attention’. In
another type of voluntary attention, effort may be required
continuously to start as well as sustain attention
throughout the activity. Such type of attention is called
‘Explicit Volitional Attention’. ‘Most of the. activities
carried out without much interest, belong to this category.

What is sometimes referred: to as ‘habitual
attention’ is akin to involuntary attention, as habitually
attending to something may make it automatic aftersome -
time. (e.g. the bus drivers attending to traffic signals).
Even in voluntary attention, interest is present, as without
some interest we will not aliend. In such cases, interest
is of an indirect nature rather than direct and immediate.

2-03 Nature / Characteristics of Attention
The following are the characteristics of attention.

i) Attention is a Selective Process: Attention is a
process of selection among items not yet entered in
the field of conciousness, a selection of some items
(stimuli) to enter conciousness while others remain
excluded.

ii) Attending is the first step in the mental process
of knowing called ‘Cognition’. Perception is the
function of attention.

iii) Attention is three dimensional i.e. attention is not
only a mental selectivity but it also involves
affective (emotion related) and conative (related
to motor activity) aspects, in the cognitive activity
attending. McDougall defines ‘attending’ as
‘Striving’ to Cognize a stimulus clearly’.

iv) Attention needs motor-adjustment like turning our
head, focussing our eyes, leaning forward etc.

v) Attention is not divisible i.e. we cannot attentively
do two things at the same time. If we try to attentively
do. two things at a time, both the activities will
suffer. :

vi) Attention is fluctuating in nature. We cannot be
attending continuously on any object for more than
10 seconds because attention shifts from one object
to another or one aspect of the object to another
aspect.

Attention, Perception and Memory 67

vii) Span of attention is limited. Span of attention
refers io the number of independent, distinct or
separate stimuli that can be attended to by an
individual, at a glance. Experiments reveal that the
adult span of attention is between 6 to 8, for
ungrouped dots.

vili) Internal factors like one's mental set, need,
interest, mood and physiological conditions of an
individual and external factors (or stimulus related
factors) like size, intensity, contrast, change,
novelty, movement, repetition etc. areuthe
determinants of attention.

ix) Interest and efforts play significant role in
attending to an object:

The reason behind our attention to an object is, that it
appears attractive to us and we are also interested in it.

2:04 Determinants of Attention
if attention is a process of selection, then the
question arisés on what basis is this selection made?

Actually there are many factors which determine the
process of attending. Those factors which reside in the

object attended to, are catled objective factors. As these
' factors operate on the individual from outside, they are

also known as ‘external’ factors. These factors include

size, intensity, contrast, novelty, movement, frequency

of repetition and systematic form of stimulus. The
Psychology of advertising makes good use of these
objective factors and the teacher also has to use them

_ profitably in the classroom.

One may attend to objects, even when many or most
of the objective factors are absent. This is made possible
due to the factors that operate from within the individual.
These factors, such as interest, relevance or need, menial
set, mood and the physiological condition operating from
within the individual are known as ‘subjective’ or
‘internal’ factors.

2:04:1 External Factors of Attention

Even if a person is not interested in any event or
object, certain characteristics of the object or event may
compel him to attend to it. Such object - related factors
are external factors of attention : They are :

i. Size : Objects of big size, arrest our attention
immediately. Full page advertisements in
newspapers capture our attention more easily
than quarter page advertisements. For the
same reason, people compete in putting up

Attention, Perception and Mernory 69
mente niin
large cut outs of political leaders, advertisement
hoarding etc. along the roadside.

ii. Intensity : As size is to figure, so is the intensity:
to the quality of the stimulus. Stimulus with high
intensity like loud sound, deep striking colours,
punchant smell etc. are highly successful in
attracting our attention. While taking a class, if
the teacher raises his tone he can overcome the
disturbing noises coming from outside and retain
the attention of his pupils on the ongoing lesson
in the class. Ma

iii. Change : Whenever there occurs sudden change
ina stimulus, it immediately attracts our attention.
For example when the fan suddenly stops,
everyone in the class looks up and see the fan.
Similarly a student sleeping in the class wakes
up immediately when silence suddenly descends
on the class. On entering into our house, we
quickly notice the changed positions of tables and
chairs in the hall. This implies that if a teacher
talks with proper modulation in his voice, he can
easily capture the attention of the students.

iv. Contrast : When‘a stimulus presents itself as a
contrast in the midst of other stimuli, it turns out
to be an attention winner e.g. A black dot in a
white shirt looks predominant. The reason for
drawing the median line on the tar road in yellow
colour, men wearing a deep coloured trouser and
light coloured shirt, writing on the blackboard with



============================================================

============================================================

Educational Psychology

vi.

white chalk etc., is to capture our attention
through the contrasting nature of the stimuli
involved. To arrest the attention of students in
the class, the teacher should use contrasting
activities like lecturing, questioning, using charts
and writing on the blackboard while teaching. °

Novelty : When a stimulus is presented in a novel
or unusual way, it attracts the attention of
everyone. For example, we used to see usually
the notice “No admission” in offices; but in an
office when we see the same notice in a different
manner like “Admission with permission only” it
immediately strikes our attention and retained in
memory for long. Similarly, when we see the
writing “Don’t kiss me please” on the back of a
lorry instead of the usual writing “Please keep
sufficient distance”, it quickly arrests our
attention. In a similar way, while teaching in the
class if the teacher instead of using the examples
given in the text book, presents illustrations from
his personal experiences, and that. too relating
to pupils immediate environment, then students’
attention will not get out of the class.

Movement : As compared to stationary objects,
moving objects easily attracts our attention. For
this reason only, the mother of a crying. child, to
divert its attention, points out to the child moving

objects like a crow, car, aeroplane and the like.

Similarly to win the attention of the people,

vii.

advertisers display hoardings with neon lights that
alternately light.up and put off so as to give ihe
appearance of movement. The classroom teacher
should also present stimulus variation like moving
to the blackboard to write, moving towards
students while questioning, using appropriate
gestures while talking etc. and win the attention
of the pupils.

Repetition : A stimulus, even of low intensity if
appears repeatedly, it succeeds in. winning our
attention. The same. business advertisement is
repeated many times in mass media like T.V,
Radio and news papers only to. attract the
attention of consumers. Human nature is to notice
that stimulus which appears again and again. To
focus the attention of the. students on any
important concept.of the lesson the teacher
should explain it two or three times. with the use
of differeni Hlustrations and.that too through
different words:

Systematic Form : Objects with systematic form
are easily attended to and retained long in our
memory as compared to objects which are
incompiete or irregular in form. (e.g. We listen to
a faint tune even in noisy surroundings). To enlist
the attention of the students, the teacher before
starting the lesson should give an over- view of
the entire iesson so that ihe siudents get a proper
and complete idea of the lesson.

The foliowing are some of the important factors of

internal Factors of Attention

attention which operate from ‘within’ us.

Interest : This plays an important role in eliciting
the attention of the grown up adults. One attends
to something when it matters to him intensely
even though none of the objective factors are
present. One’s interest which composes one’s

dominant motivational system determines what - _

one attends to. The attention of violinist walking
along the bazaar is struck at the shop selling
musical instruments, particularly violins. Every
student during admission to college applies to
courses of his interest. Students develop certain
skills on the basis of their interest. (e.g. Musical
talent, vocational skill, mathematics ability,
science talent etc. get developed on the basis of
interest of individual students). Interested
students keenly observe the lessons in the class.
Teachers should always teach in such a way as
to kindle the interest of the students.

i. Need or value : Another important subjective

factor determining attention is ‘Need’, For
example, the attention of a person waiting for bus
of a particular route will always be restricted to
buses of that route only. A hungry person easily
spots the name board of a restaurant, though it
is small in size, appears dull, but the name board
ofa nearby bookshop which is big in size may

Attention, Perception and Memory 73

not catch his attention. Hence if the teacher
before starting a lesson in the class points out
the utility of the concepts to be taught, then
students will foliow the ciass with much attention.

Mental Set : One’s mental set or disposition of
readiness to react to a particular stimulus, is
another subjective factor of attention. For
example the attention of a person who goes to
railway station to receive his friend will always
be on spotting the friend in the midst of others;
he may not even hear if somebody nearby. cails
him. The reason for this is that his mind is set
only to receive his friend. For. this reason only,
Herbart stressed the importance of preparing the
students for ithe lesson at the start of the class,
before actually teaching the lesson.

iv. Physiological condition : The physiological

condition of one’s body also determines the level
of attention. Students suffering from headache,
stomachache, fever etc. will be unable to attend
to the lesson taught in the class. Itis always better
to provide rest for those students who do not feel
well, instead of compelling them fo attend the
class. :

2:05 Ways and Means of Securing Better

Attention in the Ciass

1) To secure attention of pupils, teacher has to first

of all remove certain obstacles io attention. Poor physical
conditions of pupil, fatigue, sensory defects, etc. interfere


============================================================
--- Page 45 ---
============================================================

74 Educational Psychology

a
with attention. Unhygienic seating, uncomfortable
furniture, inadequate lighting, etc. also hinder attention.

2) The teacher has to make good use of the objective
factors of attention in his class. Loud voice, striking
diagrams, clear blackboard work, use of coloured chalks,
varied activities, novel illustrations, repetition of basic
- ideas, etc. are all of such nature.

3) At the elementary stage the teacher has to appeal
to the involuntary attention by using concrete aids, direct
experiences, play activities, appealing to the children’s
curiosity, etc. At the middle school level teachers can use
suitable techniques of motivation by stimulating acquired
interest of pupils, their hobbies, etc. to evoke voluntary
attention and foster sentiments of love for various school
subjects and activities. At the adolescent level, voluntary
attention has to be evoked by appealing to the long-term
interests of students and banking on ineir self-regard.

4) During classroom teaching. the teacher has to tell
his. pupils what to attend to. at the stage of introduction
itself by providing ihe over-view of the lesson, While
explaining a new concep, the sr sould reiale it to
the previous knowledge of the studenis and give
examples which are familiar to them (preferably spotting

them from the day to-day life situations).

5) The teacher should harness the natural interests
of pupils to the class lesson and also create new interests
of educational value. Children’s interests vary with age:
but generally all children are interested in creative,
procuctive, free and life-like activities. So there is need

for play way methods, projects, discovery approach to
teaching, activity based curriculum, etc.

2:06 Sensory Organs and Sensations

It is said that sense organs are the gateways of
human knowledge, as we get the information and
knowledge about the externa! world, only though our
sense organs. We establish contact with the world around
us by seeing, hearing smelling, tasting and touching and
adapt the appropriate reactions towards different objects,
persons, events etc. ,

Oa

Sensation produced by different sense organs are
indicated below :

Visual stimuli -» eyes -» Aural (or visual) sensation -» Seeing
Auditory stimuli ~» ears -» Auditory sensation -» Hearing
Fragrance / odour emanating stimuli -» Nose —» olfactory -»Smelling
Taste Stimuli » Tongue ~» Gustatory sensation -» Tasting
Tactile stimuli -» Skin —» Tactile sensation -» Feeling of touch.

2:06:1 Sensation

Sensation is the immediate result of a sense
organ being acted upon by appropriate stimuli. They
are the various qualities of experience that are derived
from the stimulation of the sense organs or receptors.
Sensations are qualitative differences experienced by us
with reference to quantitative stimuli that impinge on our
sense organs. The stimuli are energy waves that produce
an experience and these are transformed by the sense
organs into pulses of energy in the nervous system.


============================================================
--- Page 46 ---
============================================================

76 Educational Psychology

2:07 Perception

Perception is a psychological process in which the
sensory inputs received from the sense organs are
processed, organised and interpreted based on the past
experiences of the organism so that the nature of the
stimuli are meaningfully understood.

Perception is the process of transforming sensory
inputs to which we attend, into organised impressions
that we experience. Mental interpretation of sensation
results in perception. So, Perception = Sensation +
Meaningful interpretation.

For example, the smell we experience due to the
burning of an object is sensation and understanding that
the burning object is rubber is perception. For this
perception to occur, we should have already experienced
the smell due to the burning of rubber and retain it in our
memory. .

2:08 Determinants of Perception

The stimuli present in one's environment, produce
sensations and they constitute the objective elements of

perception. The interpretation given for the sensations

are due to the subjective elements of perception. Mental
set, concepis previously associated with the sensory
input, attitudes, ongoing needs etc. al! influence. our
perceptual experience. That is why the same stimulus is
perceived differently by different persons.

2:09:1 Law of Pragnanz
According to Gestalts, perceptual organisation is
governed by the law of pragnanz.- ‘Pragnanz’ means

‘compact but significant’. \n perceiving, we do not add
the different sensations received and edit them so as to


============================================================
--- Page 47 ---
============================================================

78 Educational Psychology

Ee
get at the meaningful interpretation of the object
perceived. We always perceive any thing as a whole
configuration or pattern so that it is simple, meaningful
and stable. For example, on seeing a man riding a cycle,
we do not perceive the cycle and the rider separately; it
appears as a whole unit to us. The mental act of
‘organising’ takes place during perception as per the
law of pragnanz. Similarly on seeing the following figure

we do not say as a collection of a circle, triangles,
squares, rectangle, arc etc.; instead we say it as a human
face. Thus we perceive everything as a whole and not its.
parts and bits.

2:09:2 Law of Proximity

According to this law, perceptual groups are favoured
according to the nearness of the parts. This means that
we perceive all closely situated or located things as a
group. Similarly the 12 parallel lines drawn below are
preceived by us as four groups of 3 lines each.

|
2:09:3 Law of Similarity

_ Wertheimer stated this law as "other things being
equal, the stimuli that are similar, will have greater
tendency to be grouped as a single unit". For example,

Attention, Perception and Memory

in figure (A), we perceive the objects in three horizontal
groups (triangles, circles and squares) whereas in figure
(B) using the same law of similarity, we perceive the

objects in three vertical groups. Aw e) ‘=

2:09:4 Law of Closure

Se,

This law indicates that closed or
completed figures are more stable than
incomplete or unclosed figures and
hence our mind fills up the gaps if any

and perceive the object as whole and
complete. For example, we perceive the figure given here
as a triangle, though there are gaps between the lines.For
this reason only, while proof reading, missing letters
escape from our attention as our mind fills up the gaps
and reads it correctly. Similarly when we read _a letter
written by us, we overlook the mistakes in it but if the
letter is given to others and read, they immediately notice
the mistakes.

2:09:5 Law of Good Continuation

It indicates that organisation in perception appears
to be going infinitely in the same direction. So, there is a
tendency for factors to give direction, movement and


============================================================

continuation, That is why the following series of dots

sessecesesenevesneeese appear to be a straight line. For this reason

only, cinema scenes though shot individually, when they

are run in a sequence at the rate of 15 frames per second,
they appear to be one and continuous.

2:10 Errors in Perception

Our perception is not always true and accurate.
Sometimes errors do creep in our perception when
our mind wrongly interprets the sensory input, which is
otherwise known as ‘llusion’.

2:10:1 llusion

liusions are wrong or mistaken perceptions which
fail to correspond with the situation as objectively
assessed. lilusions arise either because of the ambiguous
qualities of what is perceived or the state of the perceiving
person or both. For example, during night we mistake a
rope lying in the backyard for a snake. Similarly to a
person searching for a missing round 50 paise nickel coin,
even a small round tin plate will appear to be the coin.
Trees appear to be moving around, fo a passenger of a
moving train, appearance of our stationary train moving
slowly when the other train nearby starts moving, are all
due to illusion. illusions are of different types:

i) ilusion of movements (eg. A spot of light in dark
appears to be moving around)

ii} Hlusion of perspectives (eg. Two parallel lines
appear to meet at a long distance)

2:10:2 Hailucination

Hallucination is faise perception; it is different from
illusion in that, it has no sensory basis and‘it is a dream
like image often mistaken for perception. For example,
the phenomenon, of ‘Mirage’, spotting a ghost on the
tamarind tree in the outskirts of a village, hearing the
tapping sound of the house door, hearing the anklet sound
of an angel etc. are all due to hallucination. Illusions do
have apparent external stimuli but hallucinations do not
have a stimulus object. All experience illusions but few
(generally mentally ill and those under the influence of
drugs) experience hallucinations. The same situation
arouses the same illusion in all subjects, but hallucinations
occur under particular circumstances in different
individuals.

1) Memory can. be Incidental or intentional.
Intentional. memory which involves closer.attention paid
to. the material memorized; greater rehearsal and greater
tendency to categorize.material and find relationship and
association between items,.is superior to a casual
remembrance of observed events which is inciden‘al

_ 2)Memory can also be classified in tetms of degree
to which it resembles the original perception, as vivid
memory or indistinct memory. indistinct memories
influence our behaviour without our awareness.

3) Memory can be observational memory or rote
memory. Observational memory is for concrete objects

and events (e.g. Evidence of a witness to bomb explosion)
and rote memory is for words and symbols. Generally by
memory we seem to refer to rote memory and verbal
learning implies this aspect.

4) Memory can also be classified in terms of duration
of the retention period as Short term memory (STM) or
Long term memory (LTM)

2:12:1 Short and Long Term Memories

Short term memory, also called primary or working

memory, lasts for 15 to 30 seconds. We remember a

telephone number till we get the connection to that
number. We have to look at the. telephone directory, if

we are to phone after a few hours. Experimental ;

evidences show that only 7£2 separate items can be held
in short term memory af one time (referred to as Memory
span). Primary memory is not the terminal point.
Information is being transformed to long term memory
for more permanent storage. The multiplication tables we
have learnt, the poem we have memorised, our date. of
birth, wedding day, our telephone number, residential
address etc. are permanently remembered because of
our long term memory.

More time and effort are essential for moving
information into long term storage. While the capacity
for STM is limited, the capacity for LTM is unlimited. The
information passed on to LTM is placed into organised
categories, where.it resides, almost permanenily. There
appear to. be different brain processes for STM and LTM.
The transfer from STM to LTM takes place not only

Attention, Perception and Memory a.

because of rehearsal and repetition but because of
coding which is the process of analysing. information and
compressing it into abbreviated form.

The operations and control process effected by the
brain in dealing with the input information passed on to it
by the receptors of our sensory organs with respect to
STM and LTM seem to-be different as illusirated by the

are momentarily forgotten. Those information entering

into STM are immediately put into use and after that
forgotten or if considered useful and to be aetained
permanently, it is processed further so-as to put into
organised categories. and. codified. and. stored
permanently (over one minute up to many years) in the
_LTM. Acertain.amount of time (about 30 minutes) appears
to be needed in transferring information from STM to LTM.
(For example, one who has received, a jolt of the brain

often does not remember the events that just preceded

the accident but will remember those that happened 30
minutes. earlier) When we remember anything,
information is retrieved from L.T.M and put back into
S.T.M. for further processing (rehearsal and repetition),
after which the information may be again put back in
LT.M. or it may result in a response. or output. Therefore
it could be inferred that information, depending on their
degree of utility, are stored either in S.T.M. or LT. M. by
different brain processes. That is why telephone numbers
of other people are registered in our S.T. M. but telephone
numbers of our residence and office are stored in our
L.T.M.

So retentivity, the core of memory, continues to be
puzzling and not fully understood yet.

2:14 ~Signs of Good Memory

Psychologists point .out the» followingsfive
characteristics as hall marks of good memory.

1. Rapidity : One is said to have good memory, if he
could recollect his past experiences very quickly.

2. Accuracy : if one could bring back the learned
_ materials without any-distortion, he is said to have good
memory.

3. Length of Time : How long ene could retain the
learned Materials in memory before retrieving them is
also taken as a measure of good memory. —

4. Promptness of retrieval : If one is able to bring
back the learned matetials instantly with ease without
requiring any heip, he is said to have. a. goat memory.

5. Serviceableness : This refers to the recall of right
thing at the right place. Ifa candidate. is not able. to.tell
the correct answer at the time of intervi f what will.be
of use if he’could recollect the correct answer after coming
out of the interview?

2:15 Techniques of Promoting Better
‘Memory’

The capacity to retain cannot be improved by any
intrinsic manner. All that can be done is to improve the
methods of memorising. A good memory depends upon
a good brain. We shouid try to keep the metabolism of
the brain in-a good condition. Our diet should contain
calcium and phosphorous-rich products. Some tips to
improve memory through better memorising techniques
are given below :

i. Have the desire or motivation to learn, whatever
is learnt.

ii. Meaningful material is learnt quickly and
retained longer.

ili. Follow: SQ3R method while learning (survey,
questioning, recite, repeat and review)

iv. Spacing the learning periods appropriately will
help effective learning -

v. Recitation during the course of learning helps
self-evaluation. This is very useful in
memorizing, particularly in children

vi. Over-learning (learning beyond the point of

forgetting) aids retention.

vii. Rhymes and logical associations between
“different parts of the material help
remembering.

Attention, Perception and Memory BS:

Mnemonic devices (artificial associations tiké
abbreviations) are useful in learning when no
inherent organisation or association could be
seen in the material. For example to remember
the colours in a rainbow in the order, we use
the artificial word VIBGYOR.

Multisensory learning is more effectively
remembered (T.V. advertisements are
remembered better than those of Radio).

Periodical rest and sleep immediately-after
learning improve retention by Helping
consolidation of memory traces. Subjects which
interfere with each other should not be learnt
in succession.

Subjects of study should be so arranged to
avoid interferences like Pro-active and: Retro-
active inhibitions (e.g. After learning
mathematics study a language like Tamil or
English; followed by the study of science, then
learn social studies or any other light subject.

As suggested by Mandler and Herbart,
teachers shoyld plan the instruction such that
information. is: provided. in organised. manner
(i.e. grouping them in suitable clusters or
categories). In this connection ‘Ausubel also
talks about ‘advanced organisers’. Learning
through concept maps is an attempt under this
principle of organisation.
