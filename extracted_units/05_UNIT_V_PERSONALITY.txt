Unit V
PERSONALITY

5:00 introduction.

This Unit attempts to explain the meaning of the term
‘personality’, its determinants, the three approaches
followed in describing human personality and their merits
and demerits, characteristics of 'Extroverts' and ‘Introverts’
Frued's Psycho-analytic theory of personality, concept of
‘Integrated Personality’, three Important Approaches in
the Assessment of Personality viz. Subjective Methods,
Objective Methods, Projective Technique, Various
Assessment Methods under each of them and their merits
and limitations are to be discussed in detail.

5:01 Meaning of the term ‘Personality’

The term ‘persenality’ has been derived from the
Latin root ‘persona’ which referred to the facial mask
worn by Roman actors on the stage. It was the masked
face, that the actor presented to the audience and perhaps
this mask determined how a person is perceived by others
and how he affects othereople. But the term ‘personal-
ity’ today means many things to many people. Many
people look upon personality in a narrow sense as
implying bodily or physical attractiveness. Also, anyone
who displays in a superlative degree certain

-commendable traits is designated as a great personality,

indirectly implying that ordinary and average men and

women do not have personalities. But psychologically
every individual, whatever be his status in society, is a
personality or has a distinct personality.

Each person has a unique and relatively stable,
persisting organisation of characteristics that go to make
up his individual personality. Personality refers to the
“totality of what a person is”, which includes all traits
(physical, psychological as well as a variety of acquired
habitual traits) blended or organised within him in a
characteristically unique manner that determines his
modes of behaviour and his adjustments to the
environment.

5:02 Definitions of Personality

“An individual’s personality is the resuiting
individuality arising out of the interaction of a self-
conscious and intelligent person and the environment
in which he lives”. (F.S. Freeman)

“The fact that a man eats, sleeps and works does
not define his personality, rather his personality is defined
by what he eats, how he sleeps and what is distinctive
about his work pattern.” “Individuality or uniqueness
characterises one's personality. The consistent and
characteristic ways of functioning of an individual reveals
his personality”. (J.P. Guilford)

G.W. Allport has given a comprehensive definition
of personality which recognises the value of wholeness,
adjustment and distinctiveness of man's ‘personality’.
According to him “personality is a dynamic

Personality : 203

organisation within the individual of those psycho-
physical systems that determine his characteristic
behaviour and thought.”

5:03 Characteristics of Personality

From the various definitions of the term 'personality’,
following facts regarding personality could be arrived at:

i) personality is self-consciousness;
ii) itis through and through social;
iti) itis dynamic;
iv) it is the product of heredity and environment;

it is adjustable or modifiable;

)

vi) it is unique;
) itis integrated and functions as a whole;
)

it is assessable.

5:04 Uses of the Knowledge of Personality
to Teachers

i) The personality factors of pupils affect their learning
and performance in classes and knowledge of personality
characteristics of pupils is needed to give them proper
guidance. ii) Recognition of disturbed personalities of
some people will help teachers to have immediate
recourse to professional assistance so that serious. diffi-
culties may be averted. iii) Even from a personal angle,
much of our time is spent in irying to weigh up the
personalities of those around us and trying to influence
them or adjusting to them. For this purpose too, a

knowledge of ourselves, our personality traits and aiti-
tudes are essential.
5:05 Factors Influencing Personality
Development

Man, the social animal has both a body and mind.
His Personality is influenced by biological, psychological
and social factors. These three major factors and their
subcomponents are given below :

Personality Factors

Biological Sociological Psychological
Factors ' Factors Factors
i) Physique i) Home i) intelligence
ii) Chemique ii) School ii) Motivation
(endocrine glands) iii) Language iii) Emotion
iii} Nervous system iv) Culture iv) Attitude
v) Interest

vi) Sentiment

_Among these factors some are due to heredity and
others arise due to environmental influences. Among the
heredity factors most important are biological factors and
some of the psychological factors like intelligence. The
individual's biological constitution is a predisposing factor.
ti determines the general direction in which his personality
is likely to develop.

5:05:1 Biological Factors

There are three biological factors in development.

Personality 205

They are
i) Physique
ii) Chemique
iii) Nervous system

i) Physique : Height, weight, physical appearance,
physical strength, general health, physical deformities and
abnormalities influence the personality of an individual
not directly but indirectly. The child who is short statured
and physically handicapped may develop a feeling of
inferiority. The crippled persons are emotionally
unbalanced. The bodily differences do influente a
person's behaviour. The fat person may be some what
lethargic while the lean and thin person may be a bit more
active. Everyone likes beautiful objects and persons;
those who are ugly are discarded: All these things greatly
affect one's self-estimation or self-concept which is inti-
mately related to the development of personality.

ii) Chemique : By chemigue is meant the possible
effects of the ductless glands on the personality
development. Thyroid gland secretes a chemical known
as thyroxine, which controls rate of growth. When the
gland is underactive the individual becomes.lethargic and
despondent. When this gland is overactive, the individual
becomes restless, irritable and unstable.

The parathyroid gland produces calcium salts. When
this gland is underactive, the individual becomes
excessively high at activity level. When this gland is
overactive, the individual becomes quiet and slow in
activities. :


============================================================

============================================================

206 Educational Psychology
ee

The other glands like the pituitary, the sex gland, and
the adrenal gland affect the behaviour of the individual
and then his personality. These ductless glands do
interlocking activities; they are stimulating one another,
inhibiting one another and compensating one another.
They play an important role in bodily, mental, and
emotional! development.

iii) Nervous system : The efficiency of the sensory
organs depends upon the weil-developed quality of the
nervous system and we know that the sensory organs
are the gateways of knowledge. Our intellectual efficiency,
physical power, patience, the quickness of adjustment,
the readiness of acquiring new modes of responses, our
reasoning and thinking all depend on the efficiency of
the nervous system. Any injury to the system will affect
the personality of the individual.

5:05:2 Social Factors

Home, schooi, language and culture are the most
important sociological factors in influencing one's
personality.

1) Home : The different forces which influence the
personality in a home are:

i) Parental attitudes towards their children :
Parental rejection (unwanted children), over-protected
children, the only child in the family, children left in the
éare of the servants, etc. lead to distorted personality
development. Broken home, separated or divorced

Personality 207

parents, alcoholic parents, quarrelsome parenis, etc.
decisively affect the personality make up of the children.

i) Over-ambitious parents : Over-ambitious parents
want their children to achieve something which is beyond
their capacities. The result will be failure, loss of self-
respect, feeling of guilt and shame.

iii) Parental preference on the sex of the child :
Most of the parents have strong preference for boys in
our country. This results in pampering of the male children
and neglect of female children, which is highly unhealthy
for the optimum personality development of children.

iv) Step parents : Loss of any one or both parents,
children under the care of step parents, children living in
orphanages, etc. are mainly responsible for stunted
growth and personality make up of children.

v) Number of children in the family : Only child as
well as over-crowded homes will have different kinds of
undesirable impact on the development of personality of
children.

vi) Educational and socio-economic status of
parents : Educational and socio-economic status of
parents do have a telling effect upon the personality
development of their children.

vil) Other factors at home : Child-rearing practices
such as breast-feeding versus boitle-feeding, early versus
late weaning, severe versus permissive toilet training,
authoritarian versus democratic way of treatment at home

OR A

will have a lot to do in shaping and developing the
personality of the children.

11) School : Various factors in the school are
responsible in. shaping the personality of the children.
They are (i) personality of the teachers; (ji) discipline of
the school: (iii) opportunity available for various curricular
and co-curricular activities; (iv) size of the school and the
organisational climate in the school, eic.

1H) Culture : The culture in which a child is reared
exerts the broadest kind of social influence on him. Each
individual wants to succeed in his cultural group in the
three important components-occupation, marriage, and
interpersonal relationships. These are largely shaped by
the different social agencies. Cultural differences in liv-
ing habit like mode of dressing, eating, attitudes to
marriage, methods of bringing up children, family life,
value system, beliefs, etc. affect the moulding of
personality pattern of the individual. It is also true that
geographical differences also contribute to cultural dif-
ferences and hence geographical environment also
indirectly plays a role in shaping the personality of an
individual.

5:05:3. Psychological Factors
One's intelligence, motivation, attitude, emotion,

interest and sentiment are the important psychological
factors that affect the personality development.

Personality 209

5:06 Theories of Personality

Psychologists adopt the following three major
approaches to.describe personality.

(i) Type-approach : This approach to personality
attempts to classify people accerding to their psycho-
somatic types or some central themes like leadership
style, value etc.

(ii) Trait-approach : The trait-approach attempts to
list a number of basic personality traits and the personality
of an individual can be described by its position on a ¥ or
9 point scale, in each of these units.

(ill) Type cum Trait Approach : This approach
integrate the type and trait approaches to describe
individual's personality. In this hierarchial approach,
starting with the basic categories of personality, the
corresponding traits for each personality category are
identified in the next level and finally ending with specific
behavioural responses for each trait. Eysenck's theory
of personality is a typical example for this approach.

5:06:1 Type Approach to Personality.

Type approach to pérsonality attempts to classify
people into a few types, each characterising certain styles
of life, which gives it a separate identity.

—-5:06:1:01 Galen's Classification

Galen has classified people into four types according

-to their temperament as (i) Choleric (irritable)


============================================================

============================================================

210 Educational Psychology
es

(ii) Melancholic (sad) (iil) Phlegmatic (sleepy) and
(iv) Sanguine (smiling).

5:06:1:02 Kretchmer’s Classification

Earnest Kretchmer, a German Psychiatrist refers to
three broad types of human personality based on bodily
build - (i) Aesthenic (thin, long limbed and narrow
chested) who are shy, sensitive, aloof and withdrawing.
(ii) Pyknic (short, fat and barrel chested) who are jovial,
lively, outgoing with fluctuating moods. (iii) Athletic (with
strong and sturdy limbs and bones). The athletic and
aesthenic types of body build go with what is known as
Schizothyme personality and the pyknic body type goes

-with Cyclothyme personality. The former is basically
introverted and the latter extroverted. These personality
types are each prone to a distinct type of mental disorder.

5:06:1:03 Spranger’s Classification

_ Edward Spranger, a German philosopher divided
human beings, on the basis of values (or) interest in the
following six categories:

i) Theoretical: Persons: who are theoretical in
nature, neglect social and political
participation.

ii) Economic : Those persons who are interested

in money-hoarding

: Those persons who love beauty
and are busy in sensuous
gratification

iii) Aesthetic

Personality ati

iv) Social : Persons who are interested in
social activities

v) Political : Dominating and desirous of power

vi) Religious : Persons who devote themselves to
religious activities and mysticism.

Allport, Vernon and Lindzey have constructed an

" inventory to study the above six values.

§:06:1:04 Sheldon's Classification

Dr. William H. Sheldon, an American Surgeon,
classified human beings into three broad categories of
physical dimensions and their corresponding
temperamental characteristics. The three personality
types are (a) Endomorphic (round, fat and soft) (b) Ec-
tomorphic (delicate, lean and linear body build) (c)
Mesomorphy (hard and muscular): Endomorphic
individuals have the type of viscerotonia, Mesomorphs
have somatotonia and Ectomorphs have Cerebrotonia.

Temperamenially Viscerotonia implies love ofleisure,
desire for enjoyment, desire for food and sleep, interest
in child-hood experiences, eic. Cerebrotonia implies
disciplined behaviour, ready response to stimulation, lack
of interest in social interactions, hypersensitivity to pain etc.

Somatotonic personalities exhibit persistance in
behaviour, desire for adventure, courage, indifference to
pain, involvement in actions, etc. Sheldon points out that
each type of body dimension for an individual may be
rated on a7 point scale and the normal physique will be
4-4-4.

body build)

(a) Authoritarian (forces his decisions ruthlessly

§:06:1:06 Ogburn's Classification

Sociologists like Ogburn classify human personality
as (i) Revolutionist (ii) Leader (iii) Proud (iv) Gambler and
{v) Exhibitionist.

5:06:1:07 Jung's Classification

The most popular personality types are those
introduced by Cari Jung - Extroversion and Introversion.
One who exhibits extroversion is an extrovert and
opposed io him is the introvert. The extrovert is readily
susceptible to external stimulation; he likes to get deeply
involved in social activities; he is not very much bothered
by outside criticisms; he displays his emotions openly, is
less worried about failure and lacks the power of seif-
criticism. But the Introvert is immersed in his own
thoughts, memories and imaginations and is indifferent
to social situations. He often tends to conceal his
emotions, is highly sensitive to criticisms and deeply upset
by failure. He is invariably self-centred. This classification

has been criticised on the ground that in general people

have characteristics of extroversion and introversion
mixed in them at different levels and exhibit one type of
characteristics dominantly in orie situation and the other
_ set of characteristics in yet another situation. No body is
a perfect extrovert or an introvert.

§:06:2 Limitations of the Type-Approach

(b) Democratic (seeks consensus while taking
decisions)

(c) Laissez - faire (Everyone acis on his own; the
leader has no power or control over others)

One serious objection to such views is that changes
of physique often occur for individuals at middle age but
this is not often accompanied by any changes in
personality characteristics.

Type approaches have obvious limitations. Few
people fit into such distinct types easily. Jung himself says



============================================================
--- Page 115 ---
============================================================

214 Educational Psychology

that most persons appear to be atypical or ambiverts.
Even introversion-extroversion now appear to have
aspects and one who is introverted in social activity may
not be equally so in his thinking. It should be noted that
_type approach tries to describe practically useful
distinctions among persons but such distinctions are only
relative. Human personality is too rich and often ‘too
unusual to be described in one or two general types.

5:07 _—«*Trait-Approach to Personality
§:07:1 Meaning of the term ‘Trait’

A personality trait is an enduring and consistent
characteristic of a person that is observed in a wide variety
of situations. Such terms as intelligence, emotional
sensitivity, ascendence, submission, irritability, warm, etc.
are personality traits.

5:07:2 Cattell's Trait Approach to Personality

Caitell has identified 12 independent and4 secondary
traits that describe the complete personality of an
individual. These 16 personality factors are bipolar
(referring to the opposite or extreme degrees). They are :

Genialcshostile, intelligence ~ stupid, emotionally
stable changeable, dominant © submissive, cheerful
& unhappy, sensitive <= hard boiled, thoughtful and
aesthetico boorish and coarse, conscientious
slipshod, cooperatives reserved, vigorous © slack,
hypersensitive ~phiegmatic, friendly < suspicious.

Personality 218

Cattell named these 16 personality traits as ‘Source
traits’, differentiating them from ‘Surface traits’. Surface
traits are easily observable, but the real traits are source
traits which represent a deeper unity than that revealed
by surface traits.

5:07:3 Eysenck’'s Type cum Trait Approach to
Personality

Eysenck provides a hierarchical type approach to
personality combining both the type and trait approaches.
He describes three basic categories of personality at the
top of the hierarchy. ;

Extroversion <> Introversion, Neuroticism ¢ ad stability;
psychotism < normaiity.

These have been ultimately reduced to two
dimensions namely, stable «>» unstable, and
introversion  extroversion. Each of these categories

_ involves certain qualities at the next lower or trait level.

For example, the traits of an introvert would include
such qualities as persistence, rigidity of approach,
subjectivity, etc. These traits in turn are associated
with the next habitual response level. For example,
we may expect an introvert to be persistent in tasks
like problem solving, etc. generally. The last is the
specific response level which applies to specific tasks
in which also the traits involved in the Categories would
be expressed in diverse degrees. Eysenck's approach

_ is hierarchical.with the top indicating types and lower
traits.

§:07:3:01 Characteristics of 'Extroverts’
and ‘Introverts’

Extroverts are described by Eysenck as
“outgoing”, relatively uninhibited, fond of activities
which bring them into contact with other people, not
attracted by solitary pursuits like study, crave for
excitement, are aggressive, unreliable, easy going and
optimistic.

Introverts have the opposite traits such as inward,
highly reserved, shy, like to be aloof, attracted by
solitary pursuits like study, rigid, highly reliable,
persistent, and realistic (in the type approach of Jung
also we have these categories). Eysenck's research
finding also lend support to the existence of extroverts
and introverts.

5:07:4 Mertis and Limitations of Trait
Approach

§:07:4:01 Usefulness of Trait Approach

i) Trait ratings are useful in the selection and
placement of persons in courses, jobs, etc. -

Personality 217

ii) Any cumulative record listing important
personality traits is of value in the academic
evaluation as well as educational and voca-
tional guidance.

§:07:4:02 Limitations of Trait Approach

Trait approach to personality is criticised on the
following counts:

1) It does not describe how the traits are organised
(or coordinated) within the individual.

2) There may be interaction of different types of fraits
and further any trait has to be appraised according to a
range of situations and circumstances. These are not
accounted for in the trait approach. For example, boys
rated high in “aggressiveness” were not found
aggressive under all types of provocations.

5:08 Freud's Psycho-analytic Theory of
Personality

Freud's theory of personality is based on the following
two fundamental principles :

i) Structure of personality consisis of three
components which function independently and
ai the same time affect each other by their
mutual interactions. They are.: (i) ‘Ie’ the
unconscious mind (ii) ‘Ego’, the conscious mind
which corresponds to the self and (iii) ‘Super
ego’ which gets developed by the parental

EP16



============================================================
--- Page 117 ---
============================================================

218 Educational Psychology

standards and the moral standards of the
society.

ii) Human mind operates at three levels viz. (a)
Conscious (b) Unconscious and (c)
Preconscious or sub-conscious which lies
in between the conscious and unconscious.

4. Id: It is the inborn reservoir of primitive psychic
energy called ‘Libido’ which is completely unconscious
and which demands immediate satisfaction of its
unfulfilled desires (mostly sexual in nature) and instincts,
on the basis of what is known as ‘pleasure principle’
regardless of external reality. Id is the original source of
personality from which ego and Super-ego develop. All
the energy of human behaviour, says Freud, is provided
by inborn Id instincts namely sex and aggression, which
he later spoke of as ‘Life Instincts’ (Eros) and ‘Death
Instincts’ (Thanatos). Personality is moulded by the way
in which a person attempts to resolve the conflicts
between the Id's demands for immediate gratification of
these instincts and Social Constraints.

2. Ego : It develops out of the Id because of the
need of dealing with the real world around the individual.
Ego corresponds to the. ‘self’ and represents reason in
keeping the demands of the Id in check. In fact it
mediates between the unreasonable demands of Id
and the restriction laid down by the Super Ego and
as such it is the executive agency of personality, deciding
what actions are appropriate.

Personality: 219
en

3. Super-Ego : it is the system developed in the
individual by incorporating parental standards and the
moral standards of the society as perceived by the ego.
it is the internalised representation of social and moral
values and it most nearly corresponds to what is known
as ‘conscience’.

To sum up, according to Frued, personality is a kind
of an arena in which what the person wants to do (instinct

- Id) conflicts with what he has learnt he should do
morality as represented by Super Ego) and where.a
reconciliation is made and compromise arrived at ‘by
Ego). The personality of an individual gets shaped in the
following two ways based on how efficiently his / her Ego
is able to balance the Id and Super-Ego.

i). Those who have a strong Ego which succeeds
in balancing the Id and Super-Ego, will have a
healthy and balanced personality.

On the contrary, if a person-has a weak Ego which
struggles to balance the id and Ego, then tension and
conflicts occur frequently which are often managed by
adopting ‘defense mechanisms’. Frequent use of
defense mechanisms itself indicates the danger of the |
onset of maladjustment in the person.

Maladjustment - may gets expressed in two ways. If
the 'Super-Ego’ is powerful than the ‘Id’, the unconscious
desires and instincts get suppressed as a resuit of which
the individual may develop ‘Neurotic behaviour'.

eee entertain

ii) If the id is more dominant than the ‘Ego’, then
the individual may indulge in unlawful activities
and become a delinquent.

; Freud, while attempting to explain personality in
terms of the functioning of the three sub-systems viz. Id,
Ego and Super-Ego, emphasized the importance of the
fulfiiment of the sex instinct. Freud considered sex as life
energy and the fulfilment of sex instinct is one of the
primary needs of man. How far one's sex instinct is satisfied,
determines the status of personality development of an
individual. By knowing one's behaviour expressive of sex
instinct's satisfaction, we can judge at what siage of
personality development he is at.

5:08:1 Freudian Stages of Personality
Development

Freud postulated that since birth an individual passes
through four stages of psychosexual development. The
first stage is called the oral stage which spreads over
the first year of life, during which the child derives pleas-
ure through acts such as sucking, biting, etc. involving
the mouth. The 2nd.and 3rd year of life of the child is
covered by what is called the anal stage since pleasure
centres around this region at that time. This period cor-
responds to the period of toilet training and if anxieties
are felt due to. the method of toilet training, this might
sow the seed for the development of anal syndrome and
marked by excessive conformity and compulsiveness.

Personality 221

coenectenrnaannnmnsitsiemarnemnntaininatnacntaentntntittintnintn Annis t CANN CLL TE ITC ARCA

The anal stage is followed by the phallic stage
(between 4 and 5 years). Here the genitals become the
source of pleasure. itis during this period, the young boy
manifests love towards the mother and views his father
as a competitor for his mother's love. He starts imitating
his father to win his mother's love and in that way he
learns his sex role. Similarly, a girl develops a desire for
ihe father. (Frued called these as oedipus complex and
electra complex). Difficulties in development during this
stage may lead to various forms of sex deviations.

The phallic stage is followed by a period of dormancy
known as the “latency period” which is marked by a
lack of interest in sex.

Coinciding with puberty and adolescence, marked ~
by physical and sexual maturity is the stage known as
the genital stage. This lasts upto adult years. Again
pleasure centres around the genitals which now is meant
to establish stable, jong term sexual relationships.

5:09 Integrated Personality

Self-actualised personality, emotionally and socially
mature individual, well “adjusted personality, integrated
personality are all almost synonymous. Such a person
has realistic assessment of himself, his strength and
weakness, has a stable self-concept involving a higher
level of self-esteem and fewer feelings of inadequacy and
fewer evidences of compensatory behaviour and accepts
himself, leading to himself being accepted by others.


============================================================
--- Page 119 ---
============================================================

222 Educational Psychology

Integrated personality implies harmony between five
important aspects of personality, namely harmony
between one’s abilities and capabilities, harmony among
one's interests, harmony between one's abilities and
interests, harmony between one's self concept and social
constraints, and lastly, between one’s life goals and social
codes of conduct. According to Skinner the
characteristics of an integrated personality are :

- harmonious development of thoughis, feelings
and intentions to activity, affection, sympathy
and a desire to cooperate with others;

- confidence in one's abilities as well as
awareness of one's weakness; ;

Allport points out that an individual with integrated
personality will have two important characteristics.

i) Self extension : Have clear life values and believe
ihem personally and be involved in such values.

ii) Self objectification : Able.to evaluate oneself

without any bias. These two characteristics will jointly .

generate a good philosophy of life. They believe and
practise the dictum ‘Be yourself and accept yourself’.

5:10 Personality Assessment

From time immemorial attempts have been made to
predict the personality pattern of individuals through
astrology, palmistry, physiognomy and phrenology
(predicting personality traits from bumps on the skull),

Personality 223

graphology (handwriting analysis), etc., These are
pseudo-scientific techniques.

To start with, the type approach of classifying people
based on a central theme or characteristic styles of
individuals, Kretchmer, Sheldon, Spranger, Allport and
Vernon tried this ‘type’ of approach. Following Cattell,
personality tests and inventories were developed to
identify and scale the position of the different personality
traits. Scientific and objective techniques of personality
development involve collection of behaviour samples of
various kinds.

Generally before trying to measure personality, it is
necessary to draw up a list of personality traits which are
to form the basis of assessment. Personality scores
should be cautiously interpreted and must be always
supplemented by data from other sources. Only trained
and experienced persons should undertake personality
tests.

5:11 Approaches and Methods of Assessing
Personality

Various methods employed in the assessment of
personality could be grouped under three major heads
as shown below :

5:11:1. Interview Method .

Interviews involve direct interaction between the
tester and the subject and the interviewer arrives at certain
conclusions regarding an individual's standing in certain
personality traits not only from the nature of his answers
to questions asked but also from the way in which the

Personality 225

subject conducts himself during the interview and answer
questions. Interviews may be introductory, fact finding
(or informative), diagnostic or prognostic in nature.
Interviews may also be structured following a standard
pattern or unstructured (in which the interviewee
determines largely what is discussed although a skilled
interviewer may elicit a lot of pertinent information through
his limited questioning).

An interview has a beginning (to establish rapport),
a middle (to elicit information regarding personality traits)
and an end (to terminate the interview on a cordial note
‘by thanking the interviewee). The answers of the
interviewee may be noted down or tape recorded for later
analysis.

§:11:1:01 Limitations of Interview Method |

1. Interviewing is an art and this skill is not present
" in all to the same degree.

2. The problem of subjectivity involved in this
method is its biggest limitation.

3. The interviewer may dominate or humiliate the
interviewee.

4. The interviewer 4may try to thrust his ideas on
the interviewee.

society who are very busy in their work
schedules.

ii) Interview is used more for routine activities like
student admission, filling vacant posts, student
counselling, occupational guidance, medical
counselling and judicial enquiry, than for
collecting information for research.

iii) Interview is also used in research, particularly in
historical studies, clinical case studies and survey.

iv) An ably conducted interview is far superior to other
.’ forms of getting reliable information, because :

_a) No one wants to write as much as talking,
especially about themselves. People are less
cautious when talking, compared to writing.

b) As itis possible to clarify the objectives of certain
questions or their meaning, appropriate

responses could be obtained from the -

“ informants.

c) By putting cross questions, the integrity of the
respondents could be confirmed.

d) The informants cannot modify or correct the
responses they have already given to suit the
questions fielded later.

5:11:2 Rating Scales

Ratings are simply the assignment of a numerical
"score that indicates the rater's judgement of the observed

Personality 227
i enn eee
individual's standing on a given particular personality trait.
Generally rating is done on a 5 point scale (very high + 2,
high + 1, average 0, iow - 1 and very low - 2) to indicate
the degree or intensity of the trait present. Rating may
be self-rating in which the subject rates himself and
experimenter rating in which someone eise observes
and rates the subject in a number of personality traits.
Seif-rating is susceptible to distortions due to self-interest

- and so rating by others is more objective and valid.

Factors like personal bias, generosity error (rating all
near the average), inaccuracies due to the ambiguity of
the rating scale and ‘Halo effect’ (our knowledge of an
individual's rating in some personality trait influences our
rating the same individual in another unrelated trait) affect
the reliability and validity of rating. A number of rating
scales of the same individual in a variety of traits may be
combined in the form of a psychegraph or personality
profile, as given in the diagram below :

Personality profile (of bank cashier)

228 Educational Psychology

By comparing the personality profile of an individual
with those of successful men in a particular profession,
we can predict whether the individual will succeed if he
chooses that profession. This helps us in vocational
counselling.

5:11:3 Questionnaire

According to Good & Hatt, “Questionnaire refers
io a device for securing answers to questions by
using an inquiry form which the respondent fills in
himself. In it, various important questions regarding
the topic under investigation or personality traits will
find a place.”

The testee has to note down the answers for the
series of questions found in a printed sheet. From the
nature of the answers given by respondent to the
questionnaire, his personality could be judged very well.
Like questionnaires, personality inventories (usually
statement form) are also used.

_, Personality questionnaires and inventories were
éxtensively used during the World War Il to identify
soldiers with emotional disorders. A few sample questions
from Woodworth’s popular questionnaire, are indicative
of the nature of personality questionnaires.
5:11:3:01 Model Questions in a Question-

naire

1. Do you generally sleep well? Yes / No
2. Do you walk in sleep without your knowing it? Yes / No
3. Do you often feel tired? Yes / No

Personality 229

4. Was your childhood happy? “Yes / No
5. Could you mingle with your classmates

easily, without being shy? Yes / No
6. Do you easily befriend others? Yes / No

7. Are you irritated even for small hindrances? Yes / No
8. Do you often worry what others will think of you?

Yes / No

9. Are you frequently troubled with
feelings of inferiority? Yes / No
10.Do you day-dream a lot? Yes*/ No

Many personality questionnaires and inventories
consisting of such questions have been developed.
Woodworth’s personal data sheet, Allport’s Ascendence
- Submission Reaction Study, Bell's Adjustment Inventory,
The Minnesotta Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI),
Neymann Kohlsted Diagnostic Test, Cattell’s Sixteen
Personality Factor (16 PF) Questionnaire are some of
the standard personality questionnaires which are widely
used. In Minnesotta Inventory 550 statements to evaluate
10 different personality traits are included. In vocational
guidance 16 PF Form B is highly useful.

5:11:3:02 Limitatiéns of Questionnaire

i) lt is rare for any respondent to mark his real
personality characteristics in-a questionnaire. In
general, no one wants to state his / her negative
personality traits.

ii) This method is subjective; the results cannot be
verified. :


============================================================
--- Page 123 ---
============================================================

230 Educational Psychology

iii) If anyone, who does not know about himself fully
gives some information regarding himself, then the
questionnaire will lack construct validity.

5:11:3:03 Merits of Questionnaire

i) It is economical to use under various situations.

ji) - it can be used by teachers in their classrooms
without having any special training.

iii) It can be administered to a number of people at a
time: hence itis less time consuming and also highly
inexpensive.

5:11:4- _ Projective Techniques

Projective techniques strive to get at the fundamental
organisation of personality. Relatively ambiguous and

unstructured stimuli (like vague pictures, inkblots,
incomplete sentences, drawings etc.) presented to the

subject and he is asked to structure them in any way he ~

likes. in doing so the subject quite unknowingly projects
his own desires, hopes, fears, repressed wishes etc. and
thus not only reveals his inner or private world but also
gives indications on the basis of which his total personality
may be assessed. ,

Three Types of Projective Techniques
The three important types of projective techniques
are

i) Perceptive (Like Rorschach Ink blot test where
the subject is to report what he perceives of the
stimulus presented) ;

Personality 231

ji) Apperceptive (Here the subject goes. beyond
what he perceives and offers instead an
elaborate story; eg. TAT)

iii) Productive (these rely on the performance of
the subject like what he draws, what object he
makes of plastic clay, how he plays.a role etc.)

5:11:4:01 Salient Features of Projective Tests

i) Test items of projective tests are quite unfamiliar
to testees. Generally the testees may not have
prior knowledge about how to answer the test
items or what are the expected responses for
these test items. The responses of the testees
are unique, revealing his / her. personality
makeup.

ii) As the test items are presented to the testees,
in the guise of testing the subject's aesthetic
sense and imaginating ability, there is no chance
for the testees to provide fake responses by
hiding their true colours. :

ili) The test items presented are generally
ambiguous, unstructured-and vague-and as such
do not provide aay room for one's. learning,
memory or intellectual! skills.

iv) Projective tests do not demand eloborate
answers from the testees, and hence there is no
need for the skill of explaining, to make one's
ideas clear.


============================================================
--- Page 124 ---
============================================================

232 Educational Psychology

v) Here the interpretation is made not on the basis
of one's response alone but rather in relation to
the total configuration of responses.

5:11:4:02 Rorschach Ink Blot Test

This technique was developed by Harmann
Rorschach the Swiss psychiatrist in 1921.The test
materials consist of 10 cards, each card showing an ink-
blot figure which convey no specific meaning and is of
symmetrical nature on both sides. Out of these 10 cards,
five are coloured and the other five are black and white
with different shades of grey.

A) Conducting the Test
‘The subject is shown the cards in a sequential order,
one at a time. He is asked to say "what he sees in the

picture" or "what the picture reminds him of". The
subject is also to indicate the portions of the ink blot that

suggested his response. Usually there is no time limit for —

the test but some psychologists note down the reaction
time for each card and makes use of that in the final
interpretation.
B) Scoring and Analysis of Responses
Objective scoring of the responses are done based
upon three aspects (i) Location (ii) Determinants
(ili) Contents
Location : lt refers to the particular part of a blot to

which a single response refers. Some of the common
symbols used in this connection are :

Personality 233

W = Whole blot area

D = Large common detail
d = Small common detail
S$ = White space

Other details regarding the size, actual location such
as inside, edge etc. are also marked with different
symbols.

Determinants : By a determinant is meant the
particular aspect of the blot which directs the perceptual
activity. The common determinants are :

M = Movement

F = Form

G = Colour

K = Texture or surface appearances

Content : It refers to the actual meaning of the word.
The common symbols are :

H = Human figures -
A= Anirnal figures

Hd = Human details

Obj = Man made objects
Pi = Plants ’

At = Anatomical detaiis

intellectual activity is mostly indicated by F,W,D, etc.
The externalised emotions are indicated mostly by.C or
combinations like C,F and K responses. The internalised
emotional! life is indicated mostly by M. As the
administration and interpretation is a very complex

process, Rorschach ink-Blot Test could be used only by

a clinical psychologist. The test is highly useful in

psychiatry.

5:11:4:03 Murray Morgan's Thematic
Apperception Test (T.A.T)

This test consists of 20 pictures, each picture
depicting a vague social situation. The subject is required
to describe the situation as he perceives it. He is asked
to describe as to what is happening at the present
moment, as to what has led to the present position, and
as to what it is likely to lead to later on. In short, he is
asked to spin a story with the picture. While constructing
the stories, usually the individual identifies himself with
one of the characters in the picture, thereby projecting
on to them, his own feelings, urges, desifes.and anxie-
ties. The TAT responses are interpreted-by analysing the
recurring themes in the stories; the needs and frustrations
of the hero and the description of the interpersonal relation
of persons in the picture. The responses of the subject
help in understanding him. This test was developed by
Murray and Morgan. For children, a separate test (CAT)
has been developed. ;
5:11:4:04 Situational Tests. _

We can call the situational tests as a kind of
performance tests. The subjects are observed in

situations and they do not Know that they are being
assessed. The tests are camouflaged. A honesty test can

Personality 235

be conducted on young children. For example, in a
vocabulary test, a list of words may be given to the subject,
who is asked to check only the words known to him:-In
the list some fictitious words are aiso included. If asubject
checks fictitious words also he is exposing his dishonesty
by his over statement. A check list of books | have read

can be similarly loaded with fictitious titles:

Situational tests were extensively used during the
second world war.in a programme for the selection of
men for secret duties in army. Harthorne and many others
have divised a number of such situational tests and
performance tests of honesty. Such tests have poor
validity. Situational tests often involve interpersonal
situations. Situational tests may use two.techniques, one
is psychodrama and another is sociedrama..

i. Psychodrama

In psychodrama the individual has fo play a role
spontaneously in a situation. His behaviour is observed
by trained observes. This technique is used to assess
the personality of maladjusted persons. The director or
therapist plays an importapt role in organising situations
in which the subject may express his bottled up emotions.
The. central principle of psychodrama is spontaneity. of
the individual.

il, Sociodrama

_The purpose and emphasis are different in
sociodrama. In psychodrama the subject taking the roie

is involved but sociodrama portrays problems with which
the audience is concerned. It deals with the problems of
the group, its structure and thinking. Many modern
pictures written and directed by creative thinkers are the
examples of sociodrama. They reflect on the screen the
corruption, nepotism, favouritism and redtapism of the
administrative set up.

5:11:4:05 Free Association Tests

Jung developed a free association test and was
further elaborated by Kent and Rosanoff. Free
association tests involve the uttering of a stimulus word
by the tester and the subject responds immediately by
another word. The time taken for response if long may
indicate blocks, needing some more probing. The type of
responses wher analysed will give a clue to personality
characteristics.
